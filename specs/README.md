# RFCs and implementation plans

Find a decision or delivery record below. Follow the
[specification process](../docs/contributing/specifications.md) for document
choice, numbering, lifecycle, and the repository-local spec skill. Current
supported behavior belongs in [feature references](../docs/reference/README.md),
and the [platform design](../docs/design.md) owns current architecture.

<a id="lifecycle"></a>

RFCs live in `rfcs/`. All implementation plans live directly in `plans/`, with
an `rfc` frontmatter link when relevant. RFC-linked plans reuse the RFC number;
independent plans keep their own numbering sequence.
New documents use single files by default. Documents with companions use
`<number>-<topic>/index.md` inside their folder. Store status and verification limits
in their owning document, rather than repeating them in this index.
RFC entry points record their decision in `status` frontmatter; companion notes
link to that entry point through `rfc` frontmatter.

Start a new proposal from the [RFC template](../docs/contributing/rfc-template.md)
or use `$spec rfc <description>`.

Existing filenames and recorded statuses are preserved, including duplicate
numeric prefixes and date-based names. Use full filenames for those historical
IDs. Mixed design-and-delivery documents remain intact. Historical audit and
verification evidence now lives beside its owning plan or as an existing delivery
record under `plans/`; there is no separate reports workflow.

## Active specifications

This is the non-archived inventory, including completed records. A document's
recorded status is not proof of current implementation or release availability.

## Archived specifications

The existing `.archive/` keeps its content and placement; console-image links
point to a preserved Git revision after removal of `specs/assets/`. The entries below preserve
its earlier index, including recorded statuses and current-reference links.
Archive placement does not establish completion. New completed or superseded
RFCs and plans stay in their own folders. Historical commands and source links
may describe an older revision; use the [testing guide](../docs/testing/README.md)
for current verification procedures.
