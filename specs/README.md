# Specifications

This directory holds architectural decisions and implementation plans:

```text
specs/
  rfcs/      Architectural proposals and decisions
  plans/     Implementation plans and delivery records
  .archive/  Preserved historical specifications
```

An RFC defines a decision; a plan describes its implementation. Plans can also
stand alone, and link relevant RFCs through `rfc` frontmatter. Use one Markdown
file per document, or a folder with `index.md` when companions are needed.
Browse [implementation plans](plans/) directly for delivery records.
See the [specification process](../docs/contributing/specifications.md) for
authoring, numbering, and review.

## RFCs

Status reports implementation progress, separately from the historical decision
in each RFC’s `status` frontmatter. The `implementation_status` field owns the
status represented by each emoji below.

Audited on 2026-10-05 against upstream `main` at
[`6dd5e6c3075a`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-enterprise/commit/6dd5e6c3075acfb8ab74fd3f098b2708b5f115cc),
using source, current references, and existing verification coverage. This is a
source audit, not a fresh runtime test or release certification. **Implemented**
means the scoped delivery is present; **Partially implemented** means material
parts remain; **Not implemented** means the proposed capability is absent.
Explicitly separate future phases do not prevent a scoped delivery being complete.
Historical RFC bodies remain unchanged; notes below identify later amendments
and current gaps.

The Author column comes from each RFC’s `author` frontmatter. Treat the author
as the RFC owner; no separate owner field is maintained.

**✅ 8 implemented · 🟡 7 partially implemented · ❌ 3 not implemented.**

Live IdP qualification remains separate.                                                                                             | [@rclarke0](https://github.com/rclarke0)               |

Existing [IAM](../docs/reference/authorization.md) does not implement this broader contract.                                                                              | [@freeqaz-openai](https://github.com/freeqaz-openai)   |

M1.1 remains missing: an activated profile still refuses startup without any external provider.                                      | [@freeqaz-openai](https://github.com/freeqaz-openai)   |

Personal delegated-user access and protected-requester successors are explicitly later phases, outside this delivery scope.                                              | [@freeqaz-openai](https://github.com/freeqaz-openai)   |

The generic native prompt/automatic-review gate and classification contract remain absent; RFC-0014 revises the policy vocabulary.                                      | [@stevenlee-oai](https://github.com/stevenlee-oai)     |

Zero-grant enrollment, granular native permissions, and the RFC’s session-currentness/settlement guarantees remain incomplete.                                                              | [@freeqaz-openai](https://github.com/freeqaz-openai)   |

Live release qualification remains environment-specific.                                                        | [@RomneyDa](https://github.com/RomneyDa)               |

Protected model-turn proof is distinct from credential-free acceptance.                                                          | [@russellb](https://github.com/russellb)               |

The existing audit ledger is only a prerequisite.                                                                                                                     | [@freeqaz-openai](https://github.com/freeqaz-openai)   |

Native review modes remain unsupported; Codex reviewer checks do not cover later session/model changes or establish resume/reconnect enforcement. | [@stevenlee-oai](https://github.com/stevenlee-oai)     |
| [RFC-0015: Recover repository credential cleanup after broker loss](rfcs/0015-repository-credential-recovery.md)  | 🟡     | [Durable admission and terminal receipts](../docs/reference/repository-credentials.md) recover a recorded `DISPOSED` result. Provider-action recovery and settlement of active/uncertain sessions after broker loss remain unimplemented.                                          | [@kevinlin-openai](https://github.com/kevinlin-openai) |

External/refresh source types and combined repository-plus-Sandbox revisions remain unsupported; production qualification is pending.                                   | [@mrunalp](https://github.com/mrunalp)                 |

Production qualification and the Gateway-hosted secret-proxy path remain incomplete; ordinary Harnesses still allow public HTTPS.    | [@freeqaz-openai](https://github.com/freeqaz-openai)   |
| [RFC-0018: Installation profiles: openclaw and codex](rfcs/0018-installation-profiles-design/index.md)            | ✅     | The [shared renderer and two profiles](../docs/guides/deploy/installation-profiles.md), paired YAML outputs, preflight reporting, and managed Slack proxy are present. Rendering does not qualify an installed environment or its optional integrations.                           | [@kevinlin-openai](https://github.com/kevinlin-openai) |
