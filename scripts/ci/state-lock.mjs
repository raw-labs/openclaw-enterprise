// Serializes read-modify-write updates of one CI state file across processes.
//
// prepareFile and cleanupResourceIds read the lane state, run commands, and write the
// whole state back. The runner queues them in its own process, but a test may call
// prepareFile itself (a template database per file, a copy per test). Without a lock
// shared by both processes, one side's write can drop the other side's resource.
//
// The lock is `<state>.lock`, created atomically with link(2), holding the owner's pid
// and a random token. Waiters poll it. A lock whose owner process no longer exists is
// abandoned (a test killed by its timeout): a waiter renames it aside, so only one
// waiter can take it, and removes it. A reused pid, or a zombie, reads as alive, so such
// a lock is only given up at the timeout. Callers in one process queue in memory first,
// and a nested call in the same async context reuses the held lock instead of
// deadlocking. The holder keeps the lock for its whole operation (a fresh database's
// migration included), so a waiter's wait counts against its own test timeout.
