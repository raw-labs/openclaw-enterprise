# OpenClaw Enterprise

OpenClaw Enterprise (OCE) is the open source, vendor neutral platform for managing agents. Think of it as Kubernetes for agents.

The OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC) adds multi-tenancy, governance, and hard security boundaries to OpenClaw agent deployments.

## Getting started

Choose where to install:

- [Local Setup](guides/quickstart.md): run the platform on your machine, then [deploy your first Agent](guides/first-agent.md). You need an OpenAI API key for that walkthrough.
- [Kubernetes Setup](guides/kubernetes-setup.md): install the control plane on a cluster you already operate, then [deploy and verify an Agent on that installation](guides/deploy/production-agents.md).

If you are still learning the product, start with [Concepts](guides/concepts.md).
