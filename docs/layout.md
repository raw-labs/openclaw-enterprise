# Repository layout and conventions

Use this guide to choose where a change belongs in OpenClaw Enterprise (OCE).
The repository contains the OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC), its Go CLI, deployment
packaging, and documentation. Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for agent instructions
and [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and contribution workflow.

## Workspace boundaries

The root [pnpm workspace](../pnpm-workspace.yaml) explicitly selects
`apps/controller` and five packages: `utils`,
`contracts`, `occ`, `iam`, and `audit`. [TypeScript project references](../tsconfig.json) select the same
projects. Adding a directory does not enroll it in the workspace: intentional
workspace changes must also update these declarations and the
[workspace boundary check](../scripts/verify-workspace-boundary.mjs).
The configuration excludes `legacy/`; do not import archived implementations.

The Go CLI uses the root [Go module](../go.mod). The documentation renderer in
`scripts/docs-site/` has its own package manifest, pnpm workspace, and lockfile;
keep its dependency installation separate from the root workspace.
The console Storybook in `scripts/console-storybook/` is also an isolated tool
with its own manifest and lockfile. See [Console Storybook](contributing/console-storybook.md).

Start from the existing primitive that owns a capability. Keep platform core
behavior dependent on contracts; put implementation-specific behavior in the
owning Driver or Backend and wire it through composition. See
[platform architecture](design.md) for component interactions, implementation
status, and remaining design requirements.

The [repository capability](reference/repository-credentials.md#repo-driver-contract)
uses `RepoDriver` in `packages/contracts/src/repo.ts` and the bundled
`drivers/repo/github/driver.ts` adapter. Under `apps/controller/src/`, its owners are:

- `drivers/repo/credentials/`: private common sessions, custody, lifecycle,
  transport and contracts, including the private client-configuration type.
- `drivers/repo/github/credentials/`: GitHub policy, backend and closed Git/gh client bundle.
- `backends/repository-credentials/control-client.ts`: configured private-service
  connection and complete response validation.
- `composition/repository-credentials/`: registry and protected-file loading,
  platform wiring and separate-process assembly.

OCC owns immutable Agent bindings and safe session State; worker helpers connect
those records to Compute delivery. Public status omits private cleanup diagnostics.
The common engine's `RepositoryBackend` protocol is separate from `RepoDriver`.
Only the dedicated service process initializes signing and provider-token custody.
See the [Agent repository flow](flows/agent-repository-credentials.md).

Repository credential Dockerfiles live under
`deploy/runtime/repository-credentials/`, with the standalone Compose example
under `deploy/examples/repository-credentials/`. The build stages only the
selected emitted modules and minimal manifests in
`.build/repository-credentials/service` and `.build/repository-credentials/client`;
the standalone service/client images do not include the controller dependency
graph. The full `deploy/runtime/Dockerfile` uses the repository root as its build
context to include the emitted client router in the Agent image.

Select checks using the [testing guide](testing/README.md). Follow AGENTS.md's
integration requirements for runtime changes. For documentation-only changes,
use formatting, builds, and link checks; do not add or run tests solely for prose.
Do not install dependencies as a verification side effect.

## Code conventions

- Use the existing TypeScript ES module structure and strict settings in
  [tsconfig.base.json](../tsconfig.base.json). Match neighboring import style.
- Expose package APIs through a curated top-level `src/index.ts`; use `export type`
  for public types. Keep implementation helpers private and avoid ad hoc package
  subpath exports. Separate entrypoints require a deliberate runtime or platform
  boundary.
- Place shared utilities in focused modules under `packages/utils/src/` when
  they serve multiple consumers. Keep feature-specific helpers with their owner.
- Use `ts-pattern` for tagged unions and exhaustive multi-case branches; ordinary
  two-way conditions can remain `if` statements or simple ternaries.
- Use the repository's Prettier configuration for authored TypeScript, JavaScript,
  configuration, and Markdown, and `gofmt` for Go. With matching dependencies
  installed, run `pnpm format:fix`, inspect the diff, then `pnpm format:check`.
- Keep generated outputs owned by their generator. Update API schemas and routes,
  then use `pnpm openapi:generate` and `pnpm openapi:check` for
  `packages/contracts/openapi/occ-api.openapi.json`, `docs/reference/api.md`, and
  `docs/reference/cheatsheets/api.md`.

## Documentation placement

| `docs/flows/`                         | Source-backed runtime execution traces.                                                            |

| `specs/rfcs/`                         | Architectural proposals and decisions.                                                             |
| `specs/plans/`                        | All implementation plans and historical delivery records; relevant RFCs are linked in frontmatter. |
| `docs/assets/`                        | Documentation images and other shared assets.                                                      |

Use stable feature names for living references. Follow
[RFCs and implementation plans](contributing/specifications.md) for numbering,
document ownership, and lifecycle. Prefer one Markdown file per RFC or plan;
documents with supporting material use `<number>-<topic>/index.md`, with
companions in the same directory. Keep completed and superseded documents in
place. Preserve historical names and content when grouping companions. This
first phase does not reorganize `specs/.archive/`; removed image assets remain
accessible through links to a preserved Git revision.
Update affected current references, guides, and flows with behavior changes;
shipped specifications remain historical records. Keep Manual Notes unchanged.
Put detailed contracts in their owning reference rather than expanding
architecture pages for every feature.

Put contributor workflows for documentation in `docs/contributing/`, starting
with the [writing guide](contributing/documentation.md). Existing site-tooling
guides and inventories may remain directly under `docs/`; `docs/testing/` owns
code verification and test setup. Reusable writing templates belong to the local
technical-writing skill.

The [documentation map](README.md) has six menus. **Getting Started**, **Topics**,
**Integrations**, **Operate**, and **Reference** serve product users and operators;
**Contribute** serves people changing the platform. A menu opens its sidebar.
Register every Markdown page once in [docs/docs.json](docs.json) and link it from
its owning overview. Deep implementation and testing pages can use the owning
tab's `hidden` list when a contributor index links them; they keep their routes
and remain searchable. Cross-link subjects useful to both audiences.

Use relative Markdown links and sentence-case article titles and headings. Keep
sidebar labels short and in Title Case; the navigation can assign a separate
label. Changing a menu or label does not require moving a file: preserve existing
URLs and heading anchors. See the [local preview guide](local-preview.md) for
rendering. Review pages above 1,500 visible words and keep them within the
2,500-word hard limit from AGENTS.md.

When directories, package boundaries, or placement conventions change, update
this guide and affected navigation in the same change.

The optional `deploy/helm/openclaw-observability-demo/` chart owns disposable
telemetry backends. Its `files/dashboard.json` is also the Compose metrics
dashboard; Compose provisioning and scraper configurations remain under
`deploy/metrics/development/`.
