# Credential source lifecycle Flow

## Overview

An authorized caller registers a Namespace Secret with the selected Credential
Gateway, binds the resulting credential source to an Agent, deploys it, can
update its value or withdraw it from one running Agent, and later deletes the
source. The API copies the Secret value into the gateway at registration and
again on each update; OCC stores only metadata and Secret references. Admission
freezes the source identity in the AgentRevision, and the worker hands the live
source record to Kubernetes Compute. This flow stops when Compute receives the
resolved source; the
[OpenShell Sandbox provisioning flow](openshell-sandbox-provisioning.md) covers
attachment, provisioning, and readiness.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: `POST`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources[/:credentialSourceId]`,
  Agent create or PATCH and `POST …/agents/:agentId/deploy`, and
  `POST …/agents/:agentId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId/withdraw`.
- Source: `apps/controller/src/http/credential-sources.ts:createCredentialSource`
- Source: `packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`
- Source: `packages/occ/src/index.ts:deleteCredentialSource`
- Assumptions: the Installation selected a Credential Gateway that belongs to an
  `openshell` Backend, a Sandbox, and bundled Kubernetes Compute; the Namespace
  is `ready`; the caller holds the grants named in each phase.

## Execution Trace

Registration and deletion must start outside a transaction borrowed from the
same controller instance. OCC rejects an active or inherited stale context with
`ResourceConflictError` before validation or effects. Each first commits its
intermediate State record, then calls `registerSource` or `removeSource`.

### 1. Admit the registration request

`apps/controller/src/http/credential-sources.ts:createCredentialSource`,
`packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`

The route schema accepts `name`, `type`, optional `config`, and optional
`secrets` keyed by lowercase field names. Inside one transaction, OCC locks the
Namespace, authorizes `credential_source:create` on it, returns
`409 CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_NOT_CONFIGURED` when the Installation selects no
Credential Gateway, and requires a `ready` Namespace. It asks the selected gateway for `listSourceTypes`. Before any Secret
read or gateway write, it rejects a type the catalog lacks with
`CredentialSourceTypeNotOfferedError` (`409`), and an unknown or missing field
with `ScopeViolationError` (`404`).

### 2. Read Secret values

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`

OCC first rejects any Secret reference to another Namespace with
`SecretBindingValidationError` (`400 INVALID_REQUEST`, "Credential source
Secrets cannot cross Namespaces."). For each Secret reference, it then authorizes
`secret:operate`, locks the Secret (a Secret the Namespace does not hold is
`404`), and calls the owning Driver's optional
`withValue`. The Kubernetes Secret Driver verifies the stored object's ownership
labels, UID, and key before decoding it. A Driver without `withValue` fails the
request with `503`. The values exist only in memory for the next call.

### 3. Register with the gateway and commit

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`,
`packages/occ/src/index.ts:abandonCredentialRegistration`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:registerSource`

The same transaction inserts the `credential_sources` row with a new `cs_` ID,
the gateway's Driver ID, and state `registering`, plus one
`credential_source_secrets` row per field, then commits. The OpenShell provider
name derives from that ID, so the record identifies any copy the gateway stores.
OCC asks Compute's `resolveSandboxNamespace` for the Namespace's runtime
placement (the paired Sandbox's name) and calls `registerSource`
with a 30-second timeout. The OpenShell Driver ensures the Workspace's provider
profile and creates an OCC-labeled provider whose `profile_workspace` is that
Workspace; a retried create adopts only a provider with matching labels.

A `failed` or `absent` result is terminal: `abandonCredentialRegistration` calls
`removeSource` and deletes the record, or moves it to `deleting` when removal
fails. A thrown call is not terminal, because a timed-out create may still land
after cleanup. OCC calls `removeSource` but always keeps the record `deleting`,
so a later DELETE repeats the removal. On success a second transaction moves the
record from `registering` to `ready` and appends the handler's mutation audit
event. If that transaction fails or the process exits, the record stays
`registering`; admission and binding require `ready`, and DELETE removes the
copy. If a concurrent DELETE already removed the record, OCC removes the copy
again and returns `409`.

### 4. Bind the source to an Agent

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:authorizeHarnessAuthSource`

PATCH first authorizes `credential_source:operate` on each already-bound
source, without a lookup (`authorizeBoundCredentialSources`), so an
update can drop sources after a gateway change. Create and PATCH then authorize
`operate` on each requested source; before any lookup, an Installation without
a Credential Gateway fails with `CredentialGatewayNotConfiguredError` (`409`),
so source existence never changes the answer. The source must be
`ready` in the exact Namespace and owned by the selected gateway. The generated
`agents.harness_auth_credential_source_id` column references the source, so the
database rejects deleting a source an Agent draft still uses.

Every entry of `credentialSources` follows the same checks
(`packages/occ/src/index.ts:authorizeAgentCredentialSources`), which also
requires a credential-source `harnessAuth` to name a listed entry
(`assertHarnessSourceListed`, `AgentCredentialSourceBindingError`, `400`). That
rule runs after every source check, so a caller without `operate` gets `403`
first. The list is stored in
`agents.credential_sources`; the constraint
`agents_harness_credential_source_listed` enforces the same rule, and the trigger
`agent_credential_sources_are_synchronized` mirrors the list into
`agent_credential_sources`, whose foreign key restricts source deletion.

### 5. Admit the deployment

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:deployAgent`, `packages/occ/src/index.ts:admitHarnessAuth`

`assertCredentialGatewayDelivery` rejects `api_key` and both sources of
`codex_pat` with `409` while a gateway is selected. For
`credential_source`, `admitHarnessAuth` authorizes the Agent service principal's
`operate`, requires a `ready` source, and reads its catalog type, which must
declare `harnessAuth`. The frozen snapshot is `{ method, sourceId,
credentialGatewayId, sourceType, loginMode }`. `admittedCredentialSourceType`
requires a selected Sandbox, and Compute `validateHarnessAuth` requires
a dedicated Codex or native OpenClaw Harness, the paired Sandbox and gateway,
and an `openai`/`api_key` type. Compute renders no model Secret for either
Harness and passes the resolved source to Sandbox provisioning.
`admitCredentialSources` refuses a list without a selected Sandbox Driver
(`409` with its message), rechecks the caller's binding grants, then authorizes
the Agent principal's `operate` on every listed source, including the Harness source, checks each type against the
catalog, and freezes `{ sourceId, credentialGatewayId, sourceType }` entries in
the revision's `credential_sources`.

### 6. Resolve the source at dispatch

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:authorizeRevision`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:resolveRevisionSecretContext`

The worker rechecks `credential_source:operate` for the deploying actor and the
service principal; a denial ends the work item with `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED`. It
then compares the snapshot's gateway ID with its selected Driver
(`CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_MISMATCH` on a difference) and loads the current record. A
missing or `deleting` source, or one whose Driver or type differs, returns
`HARNESS_AUTH_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`. Otherwise it passes the snapshot plus the
record to Compute, which rechecks the match in `harnessAuthForRevision`. It
loads each other listed source the same way, skips the Harness source and any
source withdrawn from the revision, and returns `CREDENTIAL_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`
for one that is missing or changed.
Compute checks the list in `credentialSourcesForRevision` and attaches it after
the model source. The next owner is the [OpenShell Sandbox provisioning flow](openshell-sandbox-provisioning.md#2-derive-the-provider-owned-harness-request).

### 7. Delete the source

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:deleteCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:removeSource`

The first transaction authorizes `delete`, requires a selected gateway (`409`),
locks the source, and returns `409` while an Agent draft, active revision, or
pending deployment references it, `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_IN_PROGRESS` while only
withdrawal work holds it, or `503` if another driver registered it. Only
then does it move a `registering` or `ready` record to `deleting`; triggers
prevent leaving `deleting` and returning to `registering`. Outside the
transaction, OCC calls `removeSource`. The OpenShell Driver deletes and confirms
the owned provider, then the profile once no provider of its type remains. A
gateway failure returns `503` and leaves the record `deleting` for a retry.
Until `CREDENTIAL_REGISTRATION_FENCE_MS` (70 seconds) after `createdAt`, OCC
keeps the record and returns `503` even after a successful removal: an aborted
registration's effects finish within 30 seconds of the abort, and the Backend
caps each gateway call at 30 seconds. A second transaction deletes the record
and appends the audit event, so a completed deletion is always audited; if the
append fails, the record stays `deleting`. Namespace deletion returns
`NAMESPACE_NOT_EMPTY` while any record remains.

### 8. Update a source

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:updateCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:updateSource`

One transaction locks the Namespace and source, authorizes
`credential_source:update`, and requires a `ready` source of a type the
catalog offers (`409` otherwise). It validates any
replacement references against the catalog's Secret fields, authorizes
`secret:operate` on each Secret it reads, and reads the values with
`withValue`. It calls `updateSource` with Compute's placement while holding the
source lock; the OpenShell Driver requires the OCC-owned provider and calls
`UpdateProvider`. It then replaces the Secret references, and the handler
appends the audit event in the same transaction. The gateway is updated before
that transaction commits: a gateway failure rolls back the references, and a
later failure leaves the gateway newer than OCC until the request is repeated. An `absent` or `failed` gateway
status returns `503`. The OpenShell Driver rejects empty values because
`UpdateProvider` merges them into the existing provider. OpenShell gives the new
value only to processes started after the update.

### 9. Withdraw a source from an Agent

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:withdrawAgentCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:processCredentialWithdrawal`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:withdrawCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:withdraw`

The API authorizes `agent:operate` and requires the active revision to list the
source in `credential_sources`. For that revision, each later revision
admitted with the source, and each earlier one not yet retired, it inserts a `pending` `credential_withdrawals` row keyed by revision
and source unless one exists. It makes the caller `requested_by` of
each pending row and queues revision-scoped work with target `credentials_withdrawn`
(`packages/occ/src/state/controller-work.ts:credentialWithdrawalWorkKey`) or
expedites outstanding work. That work never deploys the revision.

The worker rechecks `agent:operate` for each pending withdrawal's
`requested_by` and calls Compute's
`withdrawCredentialSource` for each authorized one in admission order. The work retries while an authorized withdrawal is unconfirmed;
otherwise a denied requester fails it after the others are revoked, unless a
replay reassigned it. Each
revocation is audited for its requester in the pass that confirms it; each
denial or failure, once when the claim ends. The OpenShell Driver calls `DetachSandboxProvider`
on the `harnessResource` Sandbox and reads the receipt's status. Each
attempt records `last_reason` and `last_attempt_at` when its claim ends. `revoked` or `absent`
also marks the row `revoked` and appends
`openclaw.agents.lifecycle.credentials_withdraw`. Other states retry with
backoff. The read
(`packages/occ/src/index.ts:readAgentCredentialWithdrawal`) prefers these
revisions' exhausted rows, then `pending` ones, the active revision's first. Without Compute maintenance, failing the work queues
a bounded later series (`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:scheduleCredentialWithdrawalRecovery`). `withdrawalInProgress` reflects outstanding
work, so `false` means only a replay or maintenance queues another attempt.

Maintenance of the active revision (scheduled only when Compute or repository
credentials set an interval) stops preparing it once its Harness source is
withdrawn
(`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:completeWithdrawnRevisionMaintenance`). While
any withdrawal is `pending`, the pass keeps the chain; once all are `revoked`, it stops. Deploy and repair work never re-attach a withdrawn source:
a Harness source fails them with `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWN`. Either maintenance pass re-queues
pending withdrawals with no work outstanding, the other revisions' too
(`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:recoverPendingCredentialWithdrawals`); one denied
or refused waits for a replay. `authorizeRevision` skips the
`operate` recheck for withdrawn sources, so removing their grants cannot end
maintenance.

A withdrawal that finds no Sandbox records `revoked`, yet a create OpenShell
accepted before its worker lost the claim can land later with the source. So
every preparation, and every pass of a Harness-withdrawn revision,
rechecks `revoked` rows
(`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:recheckRevokedCredentialSources`): the OpenShell
Driver detaches the provider again only if `SandboxSpec.providers` lists it.

## Debugging and Verification

- `node --test tests/conformance/credential-source-occ.test.mjs` covers catalog
  validation, grants, registration compensation and recovery, audit, deletion,
  Namespace gating, admission snapshots, and Secret-backed method rejection,
  with an in-process gateway double.
- `node --test tests/conformance/openshell-gateway-wire.test.mjs` checks the
  provider, profile, update, detach, and recheck RPCs against the pinned `v0.1.3-pre.2`
  wire fixture.
- The credential withdrawal cases in
  `tests/integration/postgres-worker-agent-revision.test.mjs` run the real queue
  and worker against PostgreSQL with a Compute double: retries, outages, replays,
  refusals, maintenance, denials, other revisions, lost grants, and late creates.
- The real OpenShell test updates the source and withdraws a `bearer-token`
  source (its placeholder stops reaching an echo service), then the model
  source (the next model turn fails).
- `OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_K3D_REAL=1 node --env-file="$TEST_ENV_FILE" --test tests/integration/sandbox-driver-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs`
  registers an `openai` source through the production API against a real
  gateway and reads its live `ready` status. See [OpenShell tests](../testing/openshell.md).
- A source stuck in `deleting` returns `503` on delete until the gateway is
  reachable; `GET` shows its live `status`.
- Worker reason codes `CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_MISMATCH` and
  `HARNESS_AUTH_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` mean a changed selection or an unavailable
  source; `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWN` a withdrawn revision source, and
  `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_PENDING` an unconfirmed revocation. `CREDENTIALS_WITHDRAWN` and `WITHDRAWAL_REVISION_RETIRED` complete the work,
  and `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_UNSUPPORTED`, `COMPUTE_DRIVER_MISMATCH`,
  `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_MISCONFIGURED`, `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT`,
  and `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` fail it at once.
