# Credential source lifecycle Flow

## Overview

An authorized caller registers a Namespace Secret with the selected Credential
Gateway, binds the resulting credential source to an Agent, deploys it, can
update its value or withdraw it from one running Agent, and later deletes the
source. The API copies the Secret value into the gateway at registration and
again on each update; OCC stores only metadata and Secret references. Admission
freezes the source identity in the AgentRevision, and the worker hands the live
source record to Kubernetes Compute. This flow stops when Compute receives the
resolved source; the
[OpenShell Sandbox provisioning flow](openshell-sandbox-provisioning.md) covers
attachment, provisioning, and attachment readiness.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: `POST`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources[/:credentialSourceId]`,
  Agent create or PATCH and `POST …/agents/:agentId/deploy`, and
  `POST …/agents/:agentId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId/withdraw`.
- Source: `apps/controller/src/http/credential-sources.ts:createCredentialSource`
- Source: `packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`
- Source: `packages/occ/src/index.ts:deleteCredentialSource`
- Assumptions: the Installation selected a Credential Gateway that belongs to an
  `openshell` Backend, a Sandbox, and bundled Kubernetes Compute; the Namespace
  is `ready`; the caller holds the grants named in each phase.

## Execution Trace

Registration and deletion must start outside a transaction borrowed from the
same controller instance. OCC rejects an active or inherited stale context with
`ResourceConflictError` before validation or effects. Each operation uses an
initial transaction for the intermediate State record; after that transaction
commits, OCC calls `registerSource` or `removeSource`.

### 1. Admit the registration request

`apps/controller/src/http/credential-sources.ts:createCredentialSource`,
`packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`

The route schema accepts `name`, `type`, optional `config`, and optional
`secrets` keyed by lowercase field names. Inside one transaction, OCC locks the
Namespace, authorizes `credential_source:create` on it, returns
`409 CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_NOT_CONFIGURED` when the Installation selects no
Credential Gateway, and requires a `ready` Namespace. It asks the selected gateway for `listSourceTypes` and rejects an
unknown type, an unknown field, or a missing required field with
`ScopeViolationError` (`404`) before any Secret read or gateway write.

### 2. Read Secret values

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`

For each Secret reference, OCC rejects a foreign Namespace, authorizes
`secret:operate`, locks the Secret, and calls the owning Driver's optional
`withValue`. The Kubernetes Secret Driver verifies the stored object's ownership
labels, UID, and key before decoding it. A Driver without `withValue` fails the
request with `503`. The values exist only in memory for the next call.

### 3. Register with the gateway and commit

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:createCredentialSource`,
`packages/occ/src/index.ts:abandonCredentialRegistration`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:registerSource`

The same transaction inserts the `credential_sources` row with a new `cs_` ID,
the gateway's Driver ID, and state `registering`, plus one
`credential_source_secrets` row per field, then commits. The OpenShell provider
name derives from that ID, so the record identifies any copy the gateway stores.
OCC asks Compute's `resolveSandboxNamespace` for the Namespace's runtime
placement, the same name the paired Sandbox receives, and calls `registerSource`
with a 30-second timeout. The OpenShell Driver ensures the Workspace's provider
profile and creates an OCC-labeled provider whose `profile_workspace` is that
Workspace; a retried create adopts only a provider with matching labels.

A `failed` or `absent` result is terminal: `abandonCredentialRegistration` calls
`removeSource` and deletes the record, or moves it to `deleting` when removal
fails. A thrown call is not terminal, because a timed-out create may still land
after cleanup. OCC calls `removeSource` but always keeps the record `deleting`,
so a later DELETE repeats the removal. On success a second transaction moves the
record from `registering` to `ready` and appends the handler's mutation audit
event. If that transaction fails or the process exits, the record stays
`registering`; admission and binding require `ready`, and DELETE removes the
copy. If a concurrent DELETE already removed the record, OCC removes the copy
again and returns `409`.

### 4. Bind the source to an Agent

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:authorizeHarnessAuthSource`

Agent create and PATCH authorize the caller's `credential_source:operate` on the
requested source and, for PATCH, on the current source. The source must be
`ready` in the exact Namespace and owned by the selected gateway. The generated
`agents.harness_auth_credential_source_id` column references the source, so the
database rejects deleting a source an Agent draft still uses.

### 5. Admit the deployment

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:deployAgent`, `packages/occ/src/index.ts:admitHarnessAuth`

`assertCredentialGatewayDelivery` rejects `api_key`, `codex_pat`, and
`chatgpt_service_account` with `409` while a gateway is selected. For
`credential_source`, `admitHarnessAuth` authorizes the Agent service principal's
`operate`, requires a `ready` source, and reads its catalog type, which must
declare `harnessAuth`. The frozen snapshot is `{ method, sourceId,
credentialGatewayId, sourceType, loginMode }`. `admittedCredentialSourceType`
requires a selected Sandbox, and Compute `validateHarnessAuth` requires
a dedicated Codex or native OpenClaw Harness, the paired Sandbox and gateway,
and an `openai`/`api_key` type. Compute renders no model Secret for either
Harness and passes the resolved source to Sandbox provisioning.

### 6. Resolve the source at dispatch

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:authorizeRevision`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:resolveRevisionSecretContext`

The worker rechecks `credential_source:operate` for the deploying actor and the
service principal; a denial ends the work item with `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED`. It
then compares the snapshot's gateway ID with its selected Driver
(`CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_MISMATCH` on a difference) and loads the current record. A
missing or `deleting` source, or one whose Driver or type differs, returns
`HARNESS_AUTH_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`. Otherwise it passes the snapshot plus the
record to Compute, which rechecks the match in `harnessAuthForRevision`. The
next owner is the [OpenShell Sandbox provisioning flow](openshell-sandbox-provisioning.md#2-derive-the-provider-owned-harness-request).

### 7. Delete the source

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:deleteCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:removeSource`

The first transaction authorizes `delete`, locks the source, and returns `409`
while an Agent draft, active revision, or pending deployment references it. It
moves a `registering` or `ready` record to `deleting`; database triggers prevent
leaving `deleting` and returning to `registering`. Outside the transaction, OCC calls `removeSource`. The OpenShell Driver
deletes the owned provider, confirms it is gone, and deletes the profile when no
provider of its type remains. A gateway failure returns `503` and leaves the
record `deleting` for the caller to retry. Until
`CREDENTIAL_REGISTRATION_FENCE_MS` (70 seconds) after `createdAt`, OCC keeps the
record and returns `503` even after a successful removal: a Driver finishes an
aborted registration's effects within 30 seconds of the abort, and the Backend
caps each gateway call's deadline at 30 seconds. A second transaction deletes the
record and appends the handler's audit event, so a completed deletion is always
audited; if the append fails, the record stays `deleting` for a retry. Namespace deletion returns
`NAMESPACE_NOT_EMPTY` while any record remains.

### 8. Update a source

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:updateCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:updateSource`

One transaction locks the Namespace and source, authorizes
`credential_source:update`, and requires a `ready` source. It validates any
replacement references against the catalog's Secret fields, authorizes
`secret:operate` on each Secret it reads, and reads the values with
`withValue`. It calls `updateSource` with Compute's placement while holding the
source lock; the OpenShell Driver requires the OCC-owned provider and calls
`UpdateProvider`. It then replaces the Secret references, and the handler
appends the audit event in the same transaction. The gateway is updated before
that transaction commits: a gateway failure rolls back the references, and a
failure after the gateway accepted the values leaves the gateway newer than OCC,
which repeating the same request converges. An `absent` or `failed` gateway
status returns `503`. The OpenShell Driver rejects empty values because
`UpdateProvider` merges them into the existing provider. OpenShell gives the new
value only to processes started after the update.

### 9. Withdraw a source from an Agent

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:withdrawAgentCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:processCredentialWithdrawal`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:withdrawCredentialSource`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/credential-gateway/openshell.ts:withdraw`

The API authorizes `agent:operate` and requires the active revision to
authenticate with the source. It inserts a `pending` `credential_withdrawals`
row keyed by revision and source, or returns the existing one. Unless
withdrawal work for the revision is already queued or claimed, it queues
revision-scoped work with target `credentials_withdrawn`
(`packages/occ/src/state/controller-work.ts:credentialWithdrawalWorkKey`). That
work has its own idempotency key, never deploys the revision, and owns no
repository cleanup.

The worker loads the revision's own source and its withdrawal, rechecks
`agent:operate` for the requester, and calls Compute's
`withdrawCredentialSource`. Compute derives the Sandbox with the Sandbox Driver's
`harnessResource` and passes it to the gateway's `withdraw`; the OpenShell
Driver calls `DetachSandboxProvider` and reads the receipt's status. Each
attempt records its reason code in `last_reason` and `last_attempt_at`, in the
transaction that completes, retries, or fails the claim. `revoked` or `absent`
also marks the row `revoked` and appends
`openclaw.agents.lifecycle.credentials_withdraw`. Any other state retries with
backoff until attempts run out; the row then stays `pending`.

Maintenance of the active revision checks for a withdrawal before it resolves
the revision's credentials
(`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:completeWithdrawnRevisionMaintenance`). While
the withdrawal is `pending`, the pass queues withdrawal work as the requester if
none is outstanding, completes, and keeps the maintenance chain. Once it is
`revoked`, the pass completes without scheduling more maintenance. Deploy and
repair work that reaches the revision fails with `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWN` rather
than re-attach the source.

## Debugging and Verification

- `node --test tests/conformance/credential-source-occ.test.mjs` covers catalog
  validation, Secret `operate`, registration compensation, recovery of an
  uncertain registration, audit commit with the final state change, deletion
  refusal and retry, Namespace gating, admission snapshots, and rejection of Secret-backed
  methods with a gateway selected. It uses an in-process gateway double, not
  OpenShell.
- `node --test tests/conformance/openshell-gateway-wire.test.mjs` checks the
  provider, profile, update, and detach RPC encoding against the pinned `v0.1.3-pre.1`
  wire fixture.
- The credential withdrawal cases in
  `tests/integration/postgres-worker-agent-revision.test.mjs` run the real queue
  and worker against PostgreSQL with a Compute double: revocation after a
  pending retry, exhaustion followed by a replay, and maintenance of a
  withdrawn revision.
- The real OpenShell test updates the source through the API, withdraws it from
  the running Agent, and checks that a model turn in the same Codex process
  then fails.
- `OCC_TEST_OPENSHELL_K3D_REAL=1 node --env-file="$TEST_ENV_FILE" --test tests/integration/sandbox-driver-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs`
  registers an `openai` source through the production API against a real
  gateway and reads its live `ready` status. See [OpenShell tests](../testing/openshell.md).
- A source stuck in `deleting` returns `503` on delete until the gateway is
  reachable; `GET` shows its live `status`.
- Worker reason codes `CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_MISMATCH` and
  `HARNESS_AUTH_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` identify a changed selection or an
  unavailable source; `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWN` means the revision's source was
  withdrawn, and `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_PENDING` means the gateway has not yet
  confirmed revocation. A withdrawal's `reason` on `GET` is its latest code;
  `CREDENTIALS_WITHDRAWN` and `WITHDRAWAL_REVISION_RETIRED` complete the work,
  and `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_UNSUPPORTED`, `COMPUTE_DRIVER_MISMATCH`, and
  `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` fail it at once.
