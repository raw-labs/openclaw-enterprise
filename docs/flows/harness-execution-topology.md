# Harness Execution Topology Flow

## Overview

Deployment freezes native Harness policy, placement and authentication in an
AgentRevision. Compute prepares its workloads, publishes guarded routes and
retires predecessors before exactly-once activation audit.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: exact-Agent `POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deploy` and durable revision
  reconciliation.
- Source: `packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.deployAgent` and
  `apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker`.
- Assumptions: authorized actor; ready Namespace; same-Namespace native agent Configuration;
  explicit Agent execution mode; and a supported `harnessAuth` binding. Managed methods reference an authorized OCC
  Secret API key or a Driver-issued account-owned access-token credential.

## Execution Trace

### 1. Resolve and freeze the native harness

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.deployAgent`

OCC authorizes and locks the exact Agent and Configuration. Selected-model/provider
`agentRuntime.id` explicitly selects `codex` or `openclaw`; only an unambiguous built-in
configuration defaults to embedded OpenClaw. Missing ambiguous/plugin runtime policy, conflicting
routes, unsupported IDs, and harness/mode mismatches fail closed. OCC validates each primary
and fallback model through the same resolver and preserves their native order;
fallbacks must keep the primary provider and Harness.
The admitted revision immutably
captures its native configuration, approved harness identity/version, explicit mode, Compute
selection, and Agent ServicePrincipal. Production admits approved
`openclaw`/`embedded` and `codex`/`dedicated`, and `openclaw`/`dedicated` only when
the selected SandboxDriver provisions Harnesses with networking, filesystem, and
process containment. An associated
`access_token` additionally requires dedicated Codex; the frozen account
contains only its OCC identity, credential kind, and opaque Secret reference.

### 2. Claim work and realize the approved topology

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker`

The worker claims exact revision work, reauthorizes its actor and ownership, revalidates its frozen
approved harness, and calls `ComputeDriver.prepareRevision`.

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/docker/index.ts:DockerComputeDriver.prepareRevision`

Docker's underlying path starts embedded gateways or dedicated Codex containers,
but rejects harness-auth bindings before deployment; no Agent path is deployable.
`dockerGatewayConfigurationDocument` admits supported authentication fields/modes;
`reconcileGateway` generates `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD` only for new containers. The
[Docker gateway authentication reference](../reference/drivers/docker-compute.md#gateway-authentication)
owns the mode and password rules.

Kubernetes supports managed bindings.
SSH supports `{ "method": "runtime" }` only for embedded OpenClaw: operator
credentials remain on the host and OCC checks gateway readiness without model
validation. See the [SSH flow](pr-24-ssh-compute.md).

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:KubernetesComputeDriver.prepareRevision`

Kubernetes calls `prepareHarnessAuth` once per resolved source. From canonical
tenant storage, it delivers selected fields, including ChatGPT account tokens,
into exact revision-owned Harness Secrets. Only embedded OpenClaw or dedicated
Harnesses receive model keys, never dedicated Gateways. Fixture images use the
same namespace-local delivery; only native dedicated transport tokens depend on
runtime configuration.
See the [harness authentication flow](native-service-account-credential-delivery.md)
for admission, immutable source snapshots, and worker reauthorization.

API composition, including development, and worker startup call
`KubernetesComputeDriver.preflight` before reconciliation. Single-cluster
preflight checks every storage-namespace page and refuses legacy split targets
without changing labels or state.
The [upgrade requirements](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute.md#existing-split-layout-installations)
own the operator boundary.

Kubernetes `ensureNamespace` prepares one tenant namespace in a single cluster,
including adopted namespaces; its storage-role label enables discovery.
The two-cluster profile retains its control-cluster Gateway target.
`prepareRevision` and `activateRevision` keep dedicated Gateway and Harness Pods,
identities and PVCs separate in their selected targets. `deliverGatewaySecrets`
validates canonical sources for dedicated Gateways; `deliverHarnessAuth` creates
only the selected model/transport projection. Canonical transport and Gateway
password sources now stay separate across modes. Legacy combined sources remain
for older Pods; Compute copies their password to the separate source before
new templates reference it. If concurrent delivery creates the password source first,
Compute re-reads it and accepts only the exact-owned, identical password; conflicting
or foreign sources still fail. App-server DNS includes the Harness namespace; policies select exact
Namespace, Agent and revision peers. Harness Services select exact Namespace, Agent, revision, workload role, network
profile and Compute-owned workload name. Gateway Services omit revision for a
stable route. These selectors match NetworkPolicy before destination translation.
[Namespaces and isolation](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md#namespaces-and-isolation)
owns app-server DNS, NetworkPolicy peers and Service selectors.
`runtime.gatewayNodeSelector`
independently places the Gateway Pod and private-state initializer on trusted nodes.
With the predecessor Gateway stopped or not ready, preparation starts the candidate
Gateway once its Harness is otherwise ready. It provides the bootstrap endpoint
without changing unrelated Gateways. The revision cannot activate until its exact
workspace node is enrolled and observed.
`KubernetesComputeDriver.gatewayNativeHookRelayConfiguration` binds dedicated Codex
callbacks to the Agent's route. `AGENT_WITH_NODE_ENTRYPOINT` prepares private
capability storage and TLS trust; OpenClaw authorizes callbacks. See
[native hook routing](../reference/gateway-routing.md#native-node-endpoint).

Dedicated Codex uses workspace-node name `agent-<agent digest>-workspace`, stable
across restarts and revisions.

Dedicated Harnesses have ServiceAccounts separate from their Gateway. Compute
owns the Gateway Pod; SandboxDriver owns the native Harness. The paired native
node owns its identity, workspace, and model key. Enrollment reads a private
one-use target; restarts reuse its device token. Compute pins that device in
`dedicated-native` with `inference: "worker"`: missing/disconnected Harnesses
fail without Gateway inference. Exact callbacks and session-bound admission
scope transport to the Agent.
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:nativeRuntimeConfiguration`
projects admitted OpenAI models and an environment SecretRef into canonical
`models.providers.openai`.
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/runtime-entrypoints.ts:NATIVE_WORKER_ENTRYPOINT`
writes private node configuration with capacity, isolation, and Driver-provided
`OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR`. OpenShell's
`apps/controller/src/drivers/sandbox/openshell.ts:configureAgent` admits its data
mount as the default workspace. Native Gateway file transfer uses that workspace
unless an endpoint overrides it. OpenClaw snapshots node-local models/credentials
and derives exact managed workspaces from authorized launch descriptors, without
an inference file, grant catalog, or retired `nativeInferenceConfig` setting.

Embedded OpenClaw uses one combined workload with its exact Agent identity
and model key. The worker
has scoped Secret permissions for admitted delivery and node enrollment. Its
trusted workload-writing authority also projects tenant Secrets. Gateway Pods
receive no controller or Harness Kubernetes credentials.

The selected Sandbox consumes the same rendered projections and explicit login
mode in `HarnessWorkloadRequirements`. Unsupported upstream projection fails
without a test-only credential bridge.

Every Pod template Kubernetes Compute renders carries the ordinary
[network profile](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md#explicit-network-profiles).
Ordinary allow policies and Gateway/Harness peers require it, and readiness
rejects a template without it.

For provider-owned Harnesses, `providerHarnessReady` lists Pods by the active
Service's Agent/revision/role labels. It requires exactly one nonterminating
`Ready=True` Pod with the supplied labels; malformed/incomplete observations
enter preparation cleanup. Activation repeats this check before routing changes.
The [readiness contract](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute.md#requirements)
owns candidate rules and observation limits.

### 3. Publish safely and complete activation once

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker`

For dedicated Kubernetes execution, Compute declares
`requiresStoppedPredecessors`. `ControllerWorker.prepareRevision` stops every
earlier runtime, including its Gateway, and waits for Pod termination before
preparing the replacement, so a redeploy interrupts service until the replacement is ready.
The worker records stopped predecessors, avoiding repeated stops during pending
passes/maintenance. If one returns, Compute reports an unready successor; the
worker stops it again after one, two, four, then more claim leases. Failed
preparation, or preparing/activating that predecessor, clears its record.
Both PVCs survive downtime; recovery retries or creates a revision. New exclusive
revisions supersede old reconciliation/maintenance without automatic rollback; see
[production revision stages](../reference/drivers/compute.md#production-revision-stages).
Dedicated Codex and dedicated OpenClaw must complete a bounded native
authentication/model probe before their Harness becomes ready.
While first-deploy [workspace setup](workspace-files.md) is pending, embedded
preparation starts the replacement Gateway itself before activation. If the Gateway
of a revision that never served (its Service still selects no Pod) is unready,
for example after rejected model authentication, the next revision's preparation
repairs it with its own template instead of waiting on the failed predecessor.
The repair deletes an embedded predecessor's revision Secret and ConfigMap copies.

The worker commits the database `activeRevisionId` with an exact compare-and-set
before Kubernetes default after-commit activation.
`KubernetesComputeDriver.activateRevision` updates the shared gateway's `Recreate`
Deployment and Service. Embedded preparation does not validate the replacement's
credentials, so cutover can stop the serving gateway before the replacement
validates them in its own
[startup](native-service-account-credential-delivery.md#5-authenticate-during-runtime-startup).
Initial and replacement Gateways use the same bounded check. Failures, including
timeouts/rate limits, hold readiness until repair/restart or redeployment.
Readiness polls do not repeat model requests; worker retries do not restart
unchanged Pods. There is no automatic rollback.
Embedded activation also deletes embedded predecessor copies when it re-renders
the Gateway, even if the replacement never becomes ready.
For a dedicated predecessor, activation preserves copies while its Harness
Deployment or terminating Pod survives. Normal retirement stops the Harness
and removes the artifacts.

If activation, readiness, predecessor retirement, or audit completion fails,
the worker requeues the revision with `REVISION_FINALIZATION_INCOMPLETE`, or a
known wait's own [pending code](../reference/agents/deployment.md#pending-deployment-progress); recovery
retries activation and retirement for the already-active revision. Lost claims
and foreign/stale workloads fail closed. Dedicated activation waits for the
Gateway to report the workspace node it was handed; that wait is a 20-second
budget per revision and node across activation retries, then one status read per
retry, so a Gateway that never applies its node cannot hold the serial worker
on every retry. It and the pairing wait end early when other Work is claimable.

When stopping a revision, the Driver stops its Gateway within the pinned
runtime's 330-second stop budget and waits for Pod disappearance before stopping
the Harness, which stays available for active work. Idle shutdown, or one before
OpenClaw starts (wrappers run under `tini`), completes promptly. Forced
termination can delay the successor until the persistent owner lease expires.

Kubernetes gateways in both modes mount their own persistent SQLite and media
directories; embedded gateways also keep their attested default workspace on
that private claim so continued turns survive Pod replacement. Dedicated
Harnesses receive only the Harness workspace claim, which keeps the node
identity across Pod and revision replacement. The driver creates both claims
before their consuming Pods and relies on workload readiness instead of waiting
for `Bound`, which would deadlock `WaitForFirstConsumer` storage classes. The [Gateway storage](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/storage-and-credentials.md#gateway-storage)
contract owns the ephemeral nested Codex home and the init container that
prepares private directories and `/tmp`.

Workspace-file access uses the enrolled Harness node; Gateway and Harness share
no workspace, session, skill, or image mounts. The [storage contract](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/storage-and-credentials.md#harness-storage)
covers per-image assets and generated-image return.
The OpenClaw node host keeps Gateway-issued worker bundles in its own state and
workspaces below `/home/node/workspace`, away from gateway state, `CODEX_HOME`,
and credentials. A restart republishes image-owned
runtime assets and reconnects with the paired identity; readiness waits for the
bounded identity check. The compile cache and model-probe state stay in node
state and `TMPDIR`, which a Sandbox Driver can grant.

For a selected Sandbox Driver, stopping or retiring a revision always runs its
required cleanup after stopping a Compute-owned ordinary Harness, or delegates
provider-owned Harness removal to that cleanup. An absent ordinary Deployment
does not skip cleanup, so a cleanup failure remains retryable.
Revision retirement retains both owned claims even after stop removed the
gateway. When another revision's Gateway or route survives, retirement checks its exact
revision ownership before deleting resources. A successor in the shared namespace
keeps its Gateway Deployment, identity, Service and policies. `apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.processAgentDeletion`
retires every revision before calling
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:KubernetesComputeDriver.deleteAgentRuntimeCredentials`
to delete exact-owned private and shared claims by UID. Final deletion checks
all selected targets, independently of the Agent draft's current execution mode. Cleanup failures retry
before the worker removes the Agent's database identity. The [storage contract](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/storage-and-credentials.md#gateway-storage)
owns claim sizes, mount paths, StorageClass requirements, and final teardown.

## Debugging and Verification

- Check placement, immutable policy, and conflicts:
  `node --test tests/conformance/configuration-occ.test.mjs`.
- Check guarded activation and recovery:
  `node --test tests/integration/postgres-worker-agent-revision.test.mjs` with its explicitly
  provisioned application-role PostgreSQL database.
- Check dedicated Gateway repair after an unready predecessor:
  `pnpm test:files --test-name-pattern='dedicated replacement starts a candidate Gateway' -- tests/conformance/kubernetes-compute.test.mjs`.
- Check embedded Gateway repair after a never-served unready predecessor:
  `pnpm test:files --test-name-pattern='never-served unready Gateway' -- tests/conformance/kubernetes-compute.test.mjs`.
- Run real disposable-k3d Kubernetes coverage for both production topologies, exact identity and
  model-key placement, authenticated dedicated transport, isolated networking, and active routing.
- Run `node --test tests/integration/docker-compute-real.test.mjs` for real Docker Compose
  embedded and dedicated model turns, or
  `node --test tests/integration/harness-topology-k3d-real.test.mjs` for real Kubernetes
  model turns. Select each suite's runtime images, infrastructure, and credentials through the
  [test environment settings](../testing/docker.md#docker-compose-development-test-environment).
- Verify provider-backed dedicated Codex separately with
  `node --test tests/integration/service-account-driver-real.test.mjs`,
  `OCC_TEST_CHATGPT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_REAL=1`, and an authorized mounted
  `OCC_TEST_CHATGPT_ADMIN_KEY_PATH`; this scenario does not use `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- Treat unavailable credentials, runtime images, provider access, or either real model response as
  a verification failure. Never substitute a readiness probe, handshake, fixture, or skipped test.
- An HTTP 401 before worker admission means the callback missed the node-only
  worker ingress and fell through to the administrative route.
