# Agent Native Admin UI Flow

## Overview

OCC checks a Console user's exact Agent `use` grant and runtime assignment,
then returns the active Gateway's stable per-Agent URL. That host authenticates
the shared OCE session cookie, resolves the exact Agent, rechecks authorization,
and proxies native HTTP and WebSocket traffic.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: Console renders an Agent detail tab, calls the native admin availability API, and opens the returned Agent URL.
- Source: `apps/controller/src/console/agents/runtime-access.mjs:renderRuntimeAccess`
- Source: `apps/controller/src/http/native-admin.ts:resolveNativeAdminAvailability`
- Source: `apps/controller/src/http/native-admin.ts:handleNativeAdminUpgrade`
- Assumptions: The API has a valid controller session, `agentNativeAdmin.enabled` is true, `agentNativeAdmin.domain` and `agentNativeAdmin.sharedCookieDomain` are configured, Better Auth emits the shared session cookie at that parent domain, and private Agent gateway routing can return a `ComputeDriver.getAgentRuntimeAccess` value.

## Execution Trace

### 1. Console renders native admin availability

`apps/controller/src/console/agents/runtime-access.mjs:renderRuntimeAccess`

Agent detail requests `${path}/native-admin` with the OpenClaw panel hidden. Disabled and denied responses keep it hidden. Stopped, unavailable and unsupported responses show feedback; other read failures retain the error and **Refresh access**. Only `available` with an Agent URL shows **Open OpenClaw**, opening a new tab with `noopener noreferrer` and no launch request. After an audited `403`, tab `sessionStorage` caches the denied path for that session owner, hiding later views without another request. The [shared page cache](platform-console.md#2-resolve-the-session-before-private-reads) owns Back revalidation. Logout, sign-in or a new tab asks afresh.

`updateCurrentAgent` calls `refresh()` when deployment polling or **Refresh deployment** observes changed `activeRevisionId` or `desiredRuntimeState`. A pending read queues one further read. The panel warns that native edits do not update durable OCE configuration.

### 2. OCC protects the availability route

`apps/controller/src/http/native-admin.ts:nativeAdminStatusOperation`

`createNativeAdminAccess` owns the host interceptor, upgrade listener and socket shutdown hook. It reads the current controller through a getter so an app created before bootstrap uses the initialized controller on later requests. Shared route admission remains in `apps/controller/src/index.ts`.

`GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/native-admin` requires exact Agent `use` through the ordinary `admit` and `resolveIdentity` middleware. `read` or `operate` alone cannot admit the caller. Even `disabled` requires authorized Agent existence; it adds no unauthenticated discovery or separate `read` path.

### 3. Shared availability resolver checks feature and active revision state

`apps/controller/src/http/native-admin.ts:getNativeAdminStatus`
`apps/controller/src/http/native-admin.ts:resolveNativeAdminAvailability`
`packages/occ/src/index.ts:getUsableActiveAgentRevision`

The handler validates the human session and exact Agent `use` before calling `resolveNativeAdminAvailability`; only then can it return `disabled`. Enabled access requires a public origin and native admin domain. `controller.getUsableActiveAgentRevision` authorizes `use`, loads the Agent, and selects its active revision and newest successor. A stopped Agent without `activeRevisionId` raises `ResourceConflictError`, producing only `status: "stopped"`, including before first deployment. `DependencyUnavailableError` instead produces `unavailable`, such as while a running Agent awaits activation. The panel reports the active revision independently of the viewed snapshot. Authorization denial returns `403` with the human IAM denial audit.

A newer successor on a Compute Driver requiring stopped predecessors also produces `unavailable`: the worker removes the old workload before starting its replacement. A failed replacement leaves the old revision recorded as active without a serving workload. Both status and proxy admission check this boundary.

After active revision selection succeeds, OCC derives the native target. If the Agent's desired runtime state is not `running`, the resolver returns `stopped` with the derived host and origin. Compute qualifies trusted-proxy identity and role headers, enabled device approval, and approval scopes covering the selected role. If it cannot supply that descriptor or `nativeAdminConfigurationSupported` rejects `controlUi.enabled`, exact `allowedOrigins`, or host-header fallback/device-auth settings, the resolver returns `unsupported` with the same derived target. A missing endpoint or one that is not a clean private `wss:` URL also returns `unsupported`. Only `available` carries the private `gatewayBase`; `nativeAdminAvailabilityData` omits it from the browser response.

### 4. OCC derives the isolated Agent host

`apps/controller/src/gateway/native-admin.ts:nativeAdminTarget`

`deriveNativeAdminHost` hashes Installation, Namespace and Agent IDs into an opaque label under the configured domain. `nativeAdminTarget` replaces the `publicOrigin` hostname with that Agent host and returns `/` as its browser entrypoint.

Native-host admission resolves the irreversible hash against existing platform state. Unknown hosts, wrong suffixes, deleted Agents and non-unique matches fail closed. No persistent host registry is added.

`nativeAdminGatewayHttpBase` accepts a `wss:` endpoint without credentials, query or hash, then converts it to `https:` while preserving authority and Agent base path. Workspace-file WSS routing remains unchanged.

### 5. Shared cookie admits the Agent host

`apps/controller/src/auth/index.ts:createControllerAuth`

When native admin is enabled, startup passes `nativeAdmin.sharedCookieDomain` to
Better Auth as `OCC_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`, and Better Auth emits the ordinary OCE
session cookie at that configured shared cookie parent domain. The controller
validates that the console host and Agent host suffix fit that parent on
DNS-label boundaries and rejects public suffixes, malformed domains, or values
outside the parent. It does not infer a broader parent domain from the console
or Agent hostname. When native admin is disabled, leftover shared-cookie-domain
configuration is ignored and the console keeps the legacy host-only
`openclaw_occ` cookie prefix and scope.

A domain-scoped session cookie cannot use a host-only `__Host-` prefix. The controller keeps one canonical cookie name and scope so the browser does not choose between duplicate host-only and domain cookies during migration.

### 6. OCC intercepts native-host HTTP requests

`apps/controller/src/http/native-admin.ts:interceptNativeAdminHttp`

The `onRequest` hook calls `interceptNativeAdminHttp` before normal OCC route
handling. For hosts beneath the configured native admin domain, that early
intercept prevents the Agent origin from exposing console or controller API
routes. For Agent hosts, OCC authenticates the shared session cookie, resolves
the selected IAM identity, resolves the requested host to the exact Agent,
revalidates exact Agent `use`, selects the current active revision, and
validates native configuration support before proxying. Attributable IAM denials
during proxy admission preserve an IAM denial audit for the human session and
exact Agent instead of becoming unaudited dependency failures.

Admission reads Better Auth once and returns the verified session metadata with
the caller identity. The status and proxy paths reuse that result to check
expiry and attribute access, without a second session lookup. Each WebSocket
lease runs admission again against current session state.

`apps/controller/src/gateway/native-admin-proxy.ts:proxyNativeAdminHttp`

The HTTP proxy canonicalizes a bounded path suffix, rejects missing or nonmatching `Origin` on non-GET/HEAD requests, strips browser cookies, service keys, forwarding headers, native identity, native scopes, and upstream `Set-Cookie`, rejects service-worker script requests, rewrites same-upstream `Location` values to the Agent origin, appends `worker-src 'none'` to proxied Content Security Policy, and forwards to the private `https:` gateway base. A `502` from the gateway's user-photo route (`/api/users/<id>/avatar`) becomes an empty `404`: it means OpenClaw could not fetch a Gravatar fallback, which a dedicated Gateway without internet egress never can, and the UI shows initials for both. The native gateway never receives the OCE session cookie.

### 7. OCC proxies native WebSocket upgrades

`apps/controller/src/http/native-admin.ts:handleNativeAdminUpgrade`

The API process intercepts `upgrade` before Fastify routing. It accepts only derived Agent hosts, reuses the shared-session admission path, captures the current active revision at connection admission, and builds the same private proxy transport context. Active sockets are tracked so `preClose` destroys them during API shutdown.

`apps/controller/src/gateway/native-admin-proxy.ts:proxyNativeAdminWebSocket`

The WebSocket proxy requires a non-null exact Agent `Origin`, forwards a sanitized upgrade request to the private `https:` gateway base, and only connects the browser after the upstream returns `101`. `onConnect` appends `openclaw.agents.native_admin.websocket.connect`; `onClose` appends `openclaw.agents.native_admin.websocket.close`. The `websocket.connect` audit record includes `connectionId`; the matching `websocket.close` audit record reuses that `connectionId` and includes `closeReason`, whose value distinguishes lifecycle, revocation, dependency, client, upstream, and shutdown paths. A timer rechecks the shared-session admission path every 25 seconds, with each lease bounded to 5 seconds. Failed, denied, timed-out, or revision-changed lease checks close both sockets and preserve the IAM denial audit when authorization is the reason. An authorized reconnect uses the current active revision. Native chat does not renew the OCE session.

### 8. Runtime commits the verified role before admission

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/runtime-access.ts:humanRuntimeAccess`
`deploy/runtime/openclaw-trusted-proxy-role.patch`

The Driver selects `/people/namespaces/<namespaceId>/agents/<agentId>` and supplies `oce:<Principal ID>`, the assigned role and its policy digest. Service traffic uses a disjoint `/namespaces` route, so a missing human route rejects entry. OCC replaces browser role/identity headers with verified values.

The Driver declares the managed `oce:` prefix and exact `occ-workspace-files` identity in trusted-proxy configuration. The Gateway verifies authentication and the role digest, rejects undeclared identities and profiles linked to multiple managed identities, then commits the role through native identity authority before admission. The same checks precede HTTP authorization; native role publication retires the request's earlier authority, returning `401` before its handler runs. A separate request uses the committed role; OCC never replays it. OpenClaw enforces its configured permissions. Backend service connections retain `oce-service`; independently authenticated local owners retain their existing access.

WebSocket admission intersects client-requested operator scopes with the proxy ceiling using OpenClaw's native scope semantics. A broad UI request can therefore receive narrower session scopes without gaining general configuration or administrator access. Non-operator connections retain exact scope matching.

The same lease closes changed assignments or descriptors within 30 seconds. New HTTP requests and upgrades resolve current policy immediately; native profiles update at reconnect.

### 9. Runtime renders HTML on a separate origin

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:gatewaySandboxConfiguration`
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:reconcileGatewayRoute`

With operator sandbox routing configured, preparation and activation render the
Agent's stable preview origin and adjacent sandbox port in its native document.
The worker reconciles its GET/HEAD route, public-shell SecurityPolicy and
Agent-scoped backend ingress policy under the serving revision. A separate Helm listener admits only configured ingress
peers, and the backend targets the sandbox port instead of the admin port.
The preview domain is outside the shared session cookie scope. Native UI still
reads private file content through its authenticated connection, then delivers
it to the runtime's isolated iframe. The sandbox listener serves public shell
and registered renderer assets; runtime CSP and nested frame isolation remain
responsible for executing generated content. See the [routing contract](../reference/gateway-routing.md#public-preview-routing).

For opted-in Kubernetes gateways, `KubernetesComputeDriver.privateStateInitContainer`
copies the admitted configuration from `/etc/openclaw-managed/openclaw.json` to
`/runtime-state/home/.openclaw/openclaw.json` on the init container's writable
volume. The gateway mounts that same home subdirectory at `/home/node`, so native
edits remain Pod-local and the next Pod starts from the admitted configuration.
The init container cannot write through the gateway's later mount path.

## Debugging and Verification

- `AGENT_NATIVE_ADMIN_INVALID` at startup points to invalid native admin enablement, missing public origin, invalid Agent domain, invalid shared cookie parent domain, invalid Better Auth cookie scope, or insufficient auth secret material.
- `disabled` means the Installation has not enabled the feature.
- `stopped` means the exact Agent is not desired running. Its response has no origin or revision after stop reconciliation clears the active revision, or before the first deployment.
- `unavailable` means active revision selection failed or an exclusive Compute Driver is replacing the active workload. Check Deployment activity, including failed replacements, then refresh access.
- `unsupported` means the selected Compute Driver, gateway endpoint, or native trusted-proxy/control UI configuration cannot support the active revision.
- Wrong or unknown Agent hosts fail before gateway proxying. Check the derived host calculation, Agent lifecycle state, and `agentNativeAdmin.domain`.
- Browser requests should not contain native-admin exchange, bootstrap, callback, launch-code, state, verifier, or Agent-specific session-cookie traffic.
- The native gateway should never observe the OCE session cookie; inspect sanitized proxy inputs when testing this boundary.
- IAM denial audits should appear for attributable denied status checks, proxy admission, and WebSocket lease renewal, with the human principal and exact Agent target preserved.
- `openclaw.agents.native_admin.websocket.connect` audits should include `connectionId`; matching `openclaw.agents.native_admin.websocket.close` audits should reuse `connectionId` and include `closeReason` with one of the expected categories: lifecycle, revocation, dependency, client, upstream, or shutdown.
- Service-worker registration failure is expected: the HTTP proxy rejects `Service-Worker: script` requests and adds `worker-src 'none'` to proxied responses.
- Browser tests cover panel visibility, warning copy, available status, and opening the returned URL. Integration proof should cover shared-cookie admission, denied service API keys, unknown host denial, proxied asset loads, WebSocket reconnect, the 25-second authorization lease, revision-change closure and reconnect, and a reversible native admin edit on a disposable Agent.
- This source trace does not establish live runtime proof.
