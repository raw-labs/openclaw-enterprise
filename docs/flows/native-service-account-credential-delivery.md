# Harness Authentication Binding Flow

## Overview

An operator stores an OpenAI or Anthropic API key, or a service account token, as an OCC Secret or separately issues a
ChatGPT account credential, then selects that source through Agent `harnessAuth`.
Deployment freezes the authorized binding; the worker rechecks it and Kubernetes
renders the credential only into the model-executing workload, which
authenticates before guarded activation. With `{ "method": "runtime" }`,
the operator supplies credentials on an SSH host instead; OCC freezes only the
method and checks gateway readiness without model authentication.

Codex OAuth device login and its one-time credential handoff are **Experimental**;
see the [launch limits](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/codex-oauth-storage.md#oauth-launch-limits).

## Entry Points

- Trigger: Agent create/PATCH with `harnessAuth`, followed by the bodyless
  exact-Agent deployment action.
- Sources: `packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.createAgent`,
  `OpenClawController.updateAgent`, and `OpenClawController.deployAgent`.
- Assumptions: ready Namespace at deployment, same-Namespace source, existing
  Secret value or issued account credential, exact actor permissions, a compatible
  configured Harness/model, and selected Compute support.

## Execution Trace

### 1. Acquire or select one credential source

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.startAgentDeviceAuthorization`,
`pollAgentDeviceAuthorization`, `cancelAgentDeviceAuthorization`

Device login persists actor, exact Namespace/optional Agent scope, provider state,
and phase in the selected Secret backend; PostgreSQL stores only the Secret
reference. The selected Compute Driver owns the provider protocol in
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/device-auth.ts:startHarnessDeviceAuthorization`
and `pollHarnessDeviceAuthorization`. A successful exchange stores a complete
native bundle; HTTP responses expose only the reference and device instructions.

Each poll verifies current scope and Secret authority; Secret compare-and-swap
claims one exchange, so concurrent polls cannot consume the same code, and a late
response cannot overwrite cancellation. Unknown exchange outcomes require a new
login. Local discard never logs out or revokes upstream. Before handoff,
a ready session can supply plugin discovery through the authorized catalog path;
the Plugin Driver extracts native access and account metadata.

Before saving, Console can call the selected Compute Driver's
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/model-discovery.ts:discoverHarnessModels`
without storing the credential. OpenAI API-key discovery
omits models whose valid `shutdown_date` is today or earlier in UTC, per the
provider's [model-list contract](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/models/methods/list);
missing, null, malformed, or future dates remain, and model age and IDs do not
imply expiry. Anthropic and service account token catalogs are unfiltered. Discovery
does not prove a model call will succeed.

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.createAgent`, `updateAgent`,
`authorizeHarnessAuthSource`

Create and PATCH follow the [`harnessAuth` field semantics](../reference/agents.md#harness-authentication).
API-key, imported `codex_pat`, and OAuth sources use stable OCC Secret references; the method remains distinct even for the same Secret. The actor
needs exact Secret `operate`; a managed `codex_pat` source needs exact account `read`.
Namespace locks serialize source reference changes against deletion. Missing or
foreign sources fail closed. Binding never selects a different model, Backend,
Harness, or execution mode and cannot issue an account credential.

The [Secret storage flow](secret-storage-and-delivery.md) owns value storage;
[account issuance](service-account-driver-credential-delivery.md) owns upstream
credentials and their private Backend binding.

### 2. Freeze the admitted source and compatibility

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.deployAgent`, `admitHarnessAuth`

Deployment requires a nonnull binding, exact Agent `deploy`, and Configuration
`read`. For a key or service account token, OCC checks the actor's and Agent principal's exact Secret `operate`,
resolves the backend through the selected Secret Driver, and freezes the stable
reference and Driver identity. For a ChatGPT account, it verifies the issued
access-token reference and private Backend, member Driver, and workspace
ownership. `runtime` needs no source grant, lookup, or delivery metadata. The
selected Compute validates the combination: SSH accepts only embedded OpenClaw
with `runtime`. Kubernetes `validateHarnessAuth` requires dedicated Codex for
both imported and managed `codex_pat` sources. OAuth additionally requires
Compute-owned storage without a Sandbox Driver. Deployment and guided
provisioning reject unsupported combinations before admitting work or stopping
predecessors.

Host credential changes can affect a runtime revision after restart without
redeployment; see the
[SSH lifecycle](pr-24-ssh-compute.md).

The revision contains references and safe internal metadata, never credential
bytes. Public serialization exposes the binding but omits backend locators and
private account ownership. A later account credential cannot replace
the admitted reference; draft changes affect only the next explicit deployment.

### 3. Reauthorize the immutable revision before effects

`apps/controller/src/worker.ts:ControllerWorker.resolveRevisionBackend`,
`resolveRevisionSecretContext`

The worker authorizes the original deploying actor and required Agent Secret
grants against the admitted revision, verifies current source ownership, and
matches managed-account credential and Backend metadata against the frozen
snapshot. Revocation or a changed source rejects work before provisioning.
For `runtime`, only Agent/Configuration authorization runs; the dispatch context
carries only the method, and SSH neither reads the operator credential file nor
issues a model probe.

For an API key or directly supplied service account token, the worker resolves
backend ownership from OCC state and passes an ephemeral `ComputeRevisionContext`
without reading credential bytes or rewriting the revision. Compute then reads
the canonical CP source, verifies the admitted Secret UID or managed-account
ownership, and delivers only selected fields into the DP revision Secret.
Missing or replaced sources fail preparation. Managed PATs retain the exact account-owned token source.
Inactive revision history keeps references without retaining their sources
indefinitely; drafts, active revisions, and pending deployments block source deletion.

### 4. Prepare and place the one credential projection

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:prepareHarnessAuth`,
`KubernetesComputeDriver.prepareRevision`

One workload-rendering step converts validated references to supported
Secret projections and a closed login mode. Embedded OpenClaw receives the key
in its combined workload as `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, derived
from the immutable native model Configuration; admission requires all selected
models and fallbacks to use the same supported provider. Dedicated Codex receives
the key or account token through a revision-owned DP projection. Both
imported and managed PATs deliver only `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` as the
model credential; its separate Gateway receives none.
Neither gateway-only Configuration secret bindings nor initial runtime
provisioning, which creates only transport/channel groups, can supply model auth.

The selected Sandbox consumes these already-rendered
`HarnessWorkloadRequirements` and selects or looks up no other credential. An
upstream runtime unable to honor genuine Secret projection fails explicitly. Network policies keep the
provider-login egress the admitted auth method requires. Gateway transport
and Kubernetes workload identity credentials stay separate.

### 5. Authenticate during runtime startup

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/runtime-entrypoints.ts:AGENT_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT`,
`GATEWAY_RUNTIME_ENTRYPOINT`

Codex consumes explicit `CODEX_LOGIN_MODE`: API-key login receives the key through
stdin; both managed and imported PAT sources use `CODEX_LOGIN_MODE=codex_pat`
and `--with-access-token`. Native whoami validates and hydrates identity;
control-plane checks retain managed account and workspace ownership. Credential environment variables are deleted before the probe and app-server start. Missing or conflicting
inputs, failed login, or a failed bounded native turn against the primary model
(under the restricted [probe policy](../reference/harness-execution.md#harness-authentication))
prevent app-server startup and readiness. API-key and service-account login
state remains in the bounded ephemeral home; OAuth reuses the persistent bundle
(step 6).

The dedicated wrapper retains `APP_SERVER_TOKEN` for local plugin
authentication (with plugin status enabled, deriving it from the Agent revision
and startup identity) but omits it from the `codex login` and `codex app-server`
environments; the listener receives the current token's SHA-256
digest. The token remains in the Pod; filtering child environments does not
isolate same-UID processes.

`startAuthenticatedCodex` gives `probeCodexAuthentication` at most two
attempts within one monotonic 61-second budget. Only a subprocess `ETIMEDOUT`
schedules the second, after a one-second timer, timed out at the smaller of
30 seconds and the remaining budget; an unexplained `SIGKILL` is nonretryable.
With no termination handler during the delay, stopping the launcher prevents
the second call.

Embedded OpenClaw consumes the selected provider's native API key and runs one bounded native
primary-model probe during actual gateway startup, with tools and fallback
disabled; its 256-token output cap lets reasoning models answer within the
15-second timeout. Initial and replacement deployments use the same path; their `Recreate`
activation can stop the serving gateway before the new
process validates credentials, so a failure leaves the Agent unavailable until
repair and restart or a new deployment, with no automatic rollback.

Both runtimes capture native output and hold final failures unready with a fixed
message. Codex publishes the existing runtime failure only after retry exhaustion or a
nonretryable result. Readiness polling does not repeat
provider calls; restart or deployment starts a new bounded check. Probes may
incur usage charges and check only the primary model; see
[probe limitations](../reference/harness-execution.md#harness-authentication).

After readiness, the [activation and recovery flow](harness-execution-topology.md#3-publish-safely-and-complete-activation-once)
completes activation.
Updating a Secret leaves existing process environments and DP runtime copies
unchanged until preparation: deploy each consumer, verify a real turn, then
revoke the previous key upstream. Revision history cannot restore historical
Secret values.

### 6. Transfer OAuth refresh ownership once

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:KubernetesComputeDriver.prepareOAuthCredentials`,
`removeOAuthBootstrap`

After dedicated predecessors stop, Compute claims the source Secret with an atomic
resource-version update, binding its immutable UID to the Agent and PVC UID.
Single-cluster source and seed share the tenant namespace; two-cluster sources
use the control client. Seed Secret,
bootstrap Deployment, and private PVC use the resolved execution-plane namespace
and client.
A bootstrap-only Deployment runs
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/runtime-entrypoints.ts:CODEX_OAUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ENTRYPOINT`
and writes native auth and a generation receipt to disk. Repeating
that generation preserves the bundle. A new selected source
can replace it after predecessor termination: the script empties `codex-home`,
writes through exclusive temporaries, and re-reads both files before readiness.
A later non-OAuth revision's private-state init container removes `codex-home`.

Compute observes bootstrap readiness, replaces the original Secret value with a
consumed marker, removes the seed Secret, and waits for bootstrap Pods to
terminate; only then can Codex start. Its OAuth startup branch opens existing
auth, validates the receipt, and runs the ordinary model probe. Native refresh
writes the same persistent file. Later revisions retain the source and reopen disk;
a missing file or changed PVC fails with reconnect required.

Token brokerage remains separate work in progress. OCE never refreshes
a consumed bundle or restores its seed, and the source seal prevents ordinary
Secret updates from resetting custody.

## Debugging and Verification

- `node --test tests/conformance/plugin-compute.test.mjs` checks the filtered
  Codex child environments, startup-derived listener hash, and retained wrapper
  token. The runtime-image startup test checks the native Codex shell without a
  provider turn.
- [Container launcher tests](../testing/docker.md#verify-codex-startup-probe-recovery)
  run the generated launcher against a fixture CLI, proving recovery control
  flow, not provider acceptance. Inspect allowlisted `codex.model_probe` logs
  (no raw output) for attempt and final-code evidence.

- `node --test tests/integration/harness-topology-k3d-real.test.mjs` with
  `OCC_TEST_HARNESS_K3D_REAL=1` exercises the API binding/deploy path with
  disposable Kubernetes/PostgreSQL, genuine images, and an authorized API key,
  requiring a provider-backed turn from both dedicated Codex and embedded OpenClaw.
- [Managed-account testing](../testing/service-accounts.md) separately requires
  provider authorization, an issued ChatGPT credential, and a real Codex turn;
  API fixtures prove only admission or persistence.
- Verify Secret projections only on intended consumers, source-deletion guards,
  immutable revision metadata, dispatch denial after revoked grants, and failed
  auth preventing readiness. Use synthetic sentinels for serialized resources,
  logs, and audit disclosure checks; never print live credentials.
- [OpenShell testing](../testing/openshell.md) distinguishes explicit unsupported
  projection failure from genuine Secret delivery and model execution. A test-only
  bridge cannot establish production Sandbox support.
