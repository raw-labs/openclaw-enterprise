# Common Operational Logging Flow

## Overview

Trusted startup configuration selects the OCC logging level. Authorized Agent
deployment freezes runtime logging in an immutable AgentRevision. Optional
Collectors export reviewed operational records; PostgreSQL audit remains separate
durable evidence.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: start the API, worker, migration, or bootstrap process; deploy an
  Agent; enable the optional Docker Compose or Helm logging Collector.
- Source: `apps/controller/src/composition/installation-config.ts:loadStartupConfigurationSnapshot`
- Source: `packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.deployAgent`
- Source: `deploy/helm/openclaw-enterprise/templates/collector.yaml:logging.collector.enabled`
- Assumptions: trusted startup YAML, an authorized deployment request, selected
  Compute Driver support, and operator-owned Collector configuration when remote
  export is enabled.

## Execution Trace

### 1. Startup parses one configuration snapshot

`apps/controller/src/composition/installation-config.ts:loadStartupConfigurationSnapshot`

API and worker parse trusted YAML once and pass `startupConfiguration.logging`
to driver composition. Invalid settings fail startup before requests or work.
See the [settings reference](../reference/settings.md) for YAML shape and values.

### 2. Processes log fixed sanitized events

`apps/controller/src/server.mjs:start`

Worker (`apps/controller/src/worker.mjs`), bootstrap
(`scripts/bootstrap-installation.mjs`), and migration (`scripts/migrate-production.mjs`)
also create Pino loggers at the selected level. The API disables Fastify request
logging. Bootstrap and migration separate success protocol output from structured
failure diagnostics. Before Pino writes, `apps/controller/src/logging.ts:emitOccLogEvent`
keeps reviewed scalar fields and drops unapproved fields, credentials, provider
payloads, request/reply objects, and unsafe strings. This source boundary precedes
the separate Collector filter in step 7. For worker records, the Collector retains
allowlisted `work.operation` values and bounded `work.id` shapes. Agent stop keys
include the operation UUID; deletion keys have no operation suffix. Unsupported
values and key shapes are excluded.

### 3. Admission freezes runtime logging

`packages/occ/src/index.ts:OpenClawController.deployAgent`

If the trusted ComputeDriver declares `runtimeLogging: "driver"`, admission
validates and freezes the native document without rewriting logging fields. The
[Compute contract](../reference/drivers/compute.md#runtime-logging-ownership)
owns that pipeline; OCC logging and audit remain unchanged.

Otherwise, the SandboxDriver may transform a frozen copy of the Namespace-owned
Configuration. Deployment stamps native fields before validation: matching
`logging.level` and `logging.consoleLevel`, JSON console style, and
`diagnostics.otel.logs=false`. It drops the retired `logging.redactSensitive` key.
Runtime code owns console and tool redaction. The source Configuration is unchanged;
the immutable AgentRevision retains the admitted policy across restarts and later edits.

### 4. Compute renders settings from the revision

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/docker/index.ts:DockerComputeDriver.prepareRevision`

Kubernetes uses
`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/kubernetes/index.ts:KubernetesComputeDriver.deployment`.
Both Drivers require consistent admitted logging fields. Kubernetes mounts the
document read-only at `/etc/openclaw/openclaw.json`. Gateway logs JSON to console;
dedicated Codex app-servers use JSON stderr and host-owned arguments that disable
OTLP export and prompt logging. Lifecycle hooks and SecretBindings cannot override
those destinations.

### 5. Docker collection is an explicit development override

`apps/controller/src/drivers/compute/docker/index.ts:DockerComputeDriver.prepareRevision`

The optional `compose.logging.yaml` routes OCC, gateway, and Codex containers
through Docker's nonblocking `fluentd` driver to a pinned Collector. Docker
Compute sets runtime `LogConfig` from `OCC_DOCKER_LOGGING_ADDRESS`, which must be
reachable from the Engine. See the [Docker procedure](../guides/observability.md#docker-compose).

### 6. Kubernetes collection is bundled or equivalent

`deploy/helm/openclaw-enterprise/templates/collector.yaml:logging.collector.enabled`

The Helm Collector DaemonSet reads node CRI files and uses Pod metadata to
associate records with managed workloads. See the
[Kubernetes observability procedure](../guides/observability.md#kubernetes-and-helm)
for enablement and existing-Collector reuse, and the
[security reference](../reference/security.md#operational-log-collection-boundary)
for isolation limits.

`k8sattributes` maps identity before `transform/kubernetes-resource` removes
internal Pod labels; removing shared labels per record would lose identity for
later records in the batch. It also blocks pipeline start until its Pod cache
syncs: `filelog` reads existing CRI files immediately, and a record processed
without Pod identity is filtered out while its offset is still committed, so
startup events such as `worker.started` would otherwise be lost for good.

The chart validates one exporter destination: an IPv4 `/32` or paired namespace/Pod
selectors, with a bounded TCP port. It renders exporter egress alongside DNS/API
access. Empty Collector metrics selectors grant no ingress; paired selectors admit
port 8888. Policies are additive. The demo can export privately to Loki using
the bundled Collector or an external Collector with its own filtering policy.
Driver-owned pipelines also have separate guarantees.

### 7. Collector exports only operational classes

`deploy/logging/collector.yaml:transform/operational`

The bundled Collector keeps transport-derived identity before parsing untrusted
JSON. It classifies fixed OCC event names, `gateway` subsystem records, Codex
stderr records from `codex_app_server` plus Codex warnings and errors (not
`codex_otel`), `codex.turn` and `codex.tool_call`, and the Gateway and Harness wrappers'
stderr diagnostics: `runtime.startup_phase` keeps `occ.startup.phase` (and a
failed phase's cause as `occ.code`, such as `PLUGIN_NOT_IN_CATALOG`), and
`runtime.workspace_node` and the model probes keep `occ.code`. A failed phase or
non-`READY` probe is WARN, so a startup failure's cause reaches the backend.
`runtime.gateway_settings_overridden` is WARN with no attributes: the names of
the replaced owner settings stay in `occ agent logs`.
Kubernetes resources drop the `latest` image tag that metadata extraction reports
for a digest-only image. For retained records it keeps allowlisted
attributes and replaces the body with the event name, stripping arbitrary content;
Codex turn and tool-call bodies are fixed text, and a `codex.operational` body
keeps a short plain-text Codex message only from `codex_app_server` or the fixed
`codex_core::responses_retry` retry messages; a Codex warning without such a
message is dropped (as are span lifecycle records).
OCC `compute.preflight-warning` records retain WARN severity and bounded `occ.code`;
the local diagnostic message is excluded from remote export.
`authentication.sign-in-limit-warning` keeps `occ.code`, and
`authentication.sign-in-limited` keeps only `occ.sign_in.lane`; its local key
hash is not exported. `authentication.provider-unavailable-warning` keeps
`occ.sign_in.provider`, `.step`, `.cause` and `.status`, plus a transport code as
`occ.code`; the provider instance ID stays local. It drops malformed,
oversized, unclassified, unspecified-severity, and Codex protocol stdout records.
OpenClaw's Gateway startup failure (an `error` record with no subsystem whose
message starts `Gateway failed to start:`) is exported as
`gateway.startup_failed`, so a crash-looping Gateway's cause reaches the backend;
its body keeps the message under the same plain-text rules as `codex.operational`.
Those rules also reject a message with an argv credential flag (`-u`, `--password`)
or a `user:password` pair.
Collector-only configuration holds exporter credentials and TLS settings. Finite
queues and retries make logs best-effort; outage or overflow cannot block API
service, worker reconciliation, or PostgreSQL audit persistence.

### 8. The demo dashboard presents existing metadata

`deploy/helm/openclaw-observability-demo/templates/grafana.yaml:logs.json`

For the bundled Collector path, Loki retains event names and normalizes attributes
as structured metadata. Grafana formats metadata at query time without changing
records. External and Driver-owned pipelines require separate operator review.
See the [demo guide](../guides/observability/demo.md#read-and-narrow-operational-logs)
for panels, correlation, and authorization limits.

## Debugging and Verification

- For unexpected process levels, check the startup snapshot; for runtime levels,
  compare the admitted AgentRevision with rendered container settings.
- Use the [observability guide](../guides/observability.md#tests) for delivery,
  Collector metrics, and deployment troubleshooting.
- Packaging and Collector tests prove configuration, filtering, bounded queues,
  and startup boundaries. Select real runtime suites separately for gateway,
  Codex, model-turn, or OpenShell deployment proof.
- If a runtime Pod enters `CrashLoopBackOff` before a model turn with a config
  lock failure under `/etc/openclaw`, inspect the admitted Configuration for
  retired fields before treating the run as a completed case.
