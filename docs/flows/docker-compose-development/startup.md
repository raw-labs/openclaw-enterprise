# Compose development startup

Trace host preflight, database initialization, and API/worker startup. See the [parent flow](../docker-compose-development.md) for context.

## Overview

From a checkout, `scripts/dev-up` selects Docker or Kubernetes Compute and
starts the requested development topology. Docker Compute and Compose-backed
Kubernetes profiles run PostgreSQL, migration, bootstrap, API, and worker in
Compose. The explicitly selected Kubernetes-only profile runs them in the owned
k3d cluster. This flow ends after authenticated Installation and bootstrap
Namespace readiness; OpenShell also requires Workspace readiness.

## Entry Points

- Trigger: `./scripts/dev-up [--key-output PATH] [-- COMPOSE_GLOBAL_OPTIONS...]`.
- Source: `scripts/dev-up:require_command`
- Source: `internal/occdev/up.go:Up`
- Source: `internal/occdev/openshell_k3d.go:upK3d`
- Assumptions: the checkout-local OCC CLI is built; the selected container
  engine is running; Kubernetes profiles also have k3d and kubectl; Kubernetes-only and OpenShell
  profiles require Helm, and OpenShell requires its pinned or selected assets.

## Execution trace

### 1. scripts/dev-up: host preflight and runtime image selection

`scripts/dev-up:require_command`, `internal/occdev/up.go:Up`,
`internal/occdev/compose.go:AnalyzeCompose`,
`deploy/runtime/Dockerfile`

The helper requires `bin/occ` (`pnpm cli:build`), accepts `--key-output`, and
forwards arguments after `--` to Compose. This section traces Docker Compute.
OpenShell requires Kubernetes Compute, which defaults to the Compose control
plane; explicitly select `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_CONTROL_PLANE=kubernetes` for
[local Kubernetes-only development](../../guides/deploy/local-kubernetes-development.md).
Without a Sandbox Driver, Compose Kubernetes startup requires Node before creating resources.

Docker Compute probes Docker Engine and Compose JSON configuration support.
On failure it selects `podman`; a `docker` compatibility alias is neither
required nor sufficient. Podman requires the standalone
`podman-compose` provider and `yq` v4; the helper pins that provider so status
and stopped one-shot container behavior stay consistent.

Docker Compose supplies resolved JSON. Podman Compose supplies YAML, which
`dev-up` converts to JSON in its private temporary directory before passing it
to `./bin/occ dev analyze-compose`. The Go analyzer enforces
loopback controller and database publications and resolves the Docker runtime
image selection. The helper appends
`compose.podman.yaml` last so the worker receives Podman's reported API socket
at `/var/run/docker.sock`. The base Docker Compute worker disables SELinux
process labeling because relabeling a host engine socket is unsafe; other
services retain SELinux confinement.
The override shares one development image across migration, bootstrap, API,
and worker. To avoid repeated Podman builds, `dev-up` builds through migration
once, then starts with `--no-build`. Docker uses `up --build`. Expanded
configuration and credentials are never printed.

On macOS, run `podman` as your normal host user, without `sudo`. The k3d
workflow requires a rootful Podman machine; rootful describes the VM, not
running `podman` as root on the host.

If neither a shared runtime image nor separate gateway/Agent images are set,
the helper selects `openclaw-enterprise-runtime:quickstart` for this invocation.
It builds the default image with `deploy/runtime/Dockerfile` and the
repository-root context only when missing. Custom image references must already
exist; an incomplete custom selection fails before startup is reported successful.

Existing tags are reused even after the runtime recipe changes. Operators
[rebuild and verify the image](../../../deploy/runtime/README.md#rebuild-an-existing-image)
explicitly to pick up package changes. The runtime recipe owns packaged channel
plugins and gateway/Codex compatibility checks; `dev-up` does not install
missing plugins or verify a model turn.

### 2. compose.yaml:services.postgres and services.migrate

`compose.yaml:services.postgres`, `compose.yaml:services.migrate`

Compose starts PostgreSQL first and keeps its data in the local
`occ_postgres_data` volume. Compose declares `occ_configuration_data`, but mounts
it only into the controller for development Configuration documents. PostgreSQL
uses local-only administrator credentials to initialize the database and
checked-in local SQL to create the less-privileged
`occ_migrator` and `occ_app` roles.

The migration service waits for PostgreSQL, connects with
`OCC_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, and applies Drizzle migrations. The API and
worker never use the migrator or PostgreSQL administrator URL. `dev-up` invokes
migration through Compose, not directly.

### 3. Initialize before starting the API or worker

`compose.yaml:services.bootstrap`, `scripts/bootstrap-installation.mjs`

After migration exits `0`, Compose runs the shared initializer with development
inputs. Fresh bootstrap creates the development human administrator, the
non-Agent service administrator, the singleton Installation, native IAM seed,
audit evidence, and the initial service-key response. It also creates the
initial `default` Namespace in `provisioning` state and queues worker
reconciliation; the worker later provisions its backing Docker boundary.
Existing Installations retain their Namespaces, accounts, keys, IAM policy,
configuration, and revision history. Missing, expired, or revoked keys do not
trigger another bootstrap issue.

Only the initializer mounts `occ_bootstrap_data`; the API and worker load
committed state after initializer success. The
[bootstrap flow](../local-password-authentication.md) owns credentials, concurrent
attempts, and failure recovery.

### 4. The API admits only local development traffic

`apps/controller/src/server.mjs:start`,
`apps/controller/src/composition/development-postgres.ts:createDevelopmentConfigurationDriver`,
`apps/controller/src/drivers/configuration/filesystem/index.ts:FilesystemConfigurationDriver`

The API starts in `NODE_ENV=development`, binds inside the Compose network, and
publishes its host port only on `127.0.0.1`. `OCC_AUTH_SECRET` signs user
sessions and `OCC_AUTH_BASE_URL` fixes the cookie origin.

Development accepts the explicitly configured Compose bridge CIDR as local
control-plane traffic, while non-loopback clients, forwarded headers,
caller-supplied identity headers, bearer credentials, and trusted-proxy claims
remain rejected. The API uses the application-role PostgreSQL URL and never
receives the container-engine socket.

After the controller health check passes, `dev-up` waits for the worker
readiness probe before copying the initializer-owned service-key JSON from the
stopped bootstrap container. Docker Compose performs the Docker copy. Because
`podman-compose` has no `cp` command, the helper identifies exactly one scoped
bootstrap container from Compose status labels and invokes `podman cp` by ID.
`--key-output` must name an absent destination in a private operator-owned
directory; otherwise the helper creates a private temporary directory. The
helper never overwrites an existing local file, never prints `data.key`, and
never reruns bootstrap to replace a missing key.

`dev-up` then reads the Installation with `./bin/occ installation get` and the
copied service-key response. `apps/controller/src/auth/index.ts:ControllerAdmissionVerifier.verify`
validates the `x-api-key` and maps it to the Installation-scoped service
administrator; current IAM policy still authorizes each resource operation. The
startup proof succeeds only when the returned resource ID matches the copied
key response's `meta.installationId`. An invalid, expired,
or revoked key fails with `401` without cookie fallback. The
[service-key flow](../service-api-keys.md) owns admission details.

When `OCC_CONFIG_PATH` is absent, PostgreSQL-backed development selects the
filesystem Configuration Driver from `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_CONFIGURATION_ROOT`.
Compose sets that root to `/app/.development/configurations` and backs it with
the `occ_configuration_data` named volume. PostgreSQL remains the OCC metadata
system of record; native Configuration documents live in that driver-owned
volume.

### 5. The worker selects Docker compute and claims durable work

`apps/controller/src/worker.mjs:configuration`

After the controller is healthy, the worker starts with the same
application-role `OCC_DATABASE_URL`. Without `OCC_CONFIG_PATH`, development
selects `compute-docker-development` with implementation `docker-local`. An
explicit `OCC_CONFIG_PATH` selects the trusted Driver set described by that file.

The worker loads the singleton Installation, validates persisted IAM policy,
and polls the PostgreSQL work queue. Readiness means it can claim durable work;
it does not mean an Agent, AgentRevision, or TUI exists. Each claimed operation
reauthorizes the original actor before calling Compute. The worker is the only
Compose service with Docker-compatible engine access and does not mount the
configuration volume.

<span id="default-kubernetes-only-startup"></span>

### Kubernetes-only startup

`internal/occdev/openshell_k3d.go:upK3d`,
`internal/occdev/gateway_k3d.go:installDevelopmentRoutingControllers`,
`internal/occdev/repository_k3d.go:enableDevelopmentRepository`.

Both profiles use legacy iptables and honor an explicit IPv4 node resolver
without changing host DNS;
`internal/occdev/node_dns_k3d.go:checkDevelopmentNodeDNS` fails startup on
refused node DNS. Kubernetes-only startup imports matching OCE images and runs
PostgreSQL, migration, bootstrap, API and worker in Kubernetes.

Without OpenShell, it verifies the pinned cert-manager and Envoy Gateway
manifests and waits for the k3s-owned Gateway API CRDs before installing Envoy,
printing k3s add-on status before rollback on failure.
`internal/occdev/gateway_k3d.go:waitForCRDEstablished` polls each CRD every
second until `Established`, stopping on a `kubectl` error or startup
timeout. Before configuring gateway proxy trust,
`internal/occdev/network_k3d.go:verifyDevelopmentNetworkPolicy`
checks allowed and denied Pod traffic with credential-free Pods and a temporary
policy. After bootstrap creates the initial Gateway Namespace, it rechecks the
Driver's policies. Probe Pods use short graceful shutdowns and
UID-preconditioned deletes. Cleanup waits for the selector-matching Pods before
removing their egress policy; any probe or cleanup failure fails startup. This
is a point-in-time, single-node check.

Before writing the Installation, `scripts/prepare-development-codex-seccomp.mjs`
probes the imported runtime in a credential-free Pod on the owned node. If
`RuntimeDefault` blocks the sandbox, the shared reviewed generator derives a
content-addressed Localhost profile from that node's effective policy. Startup
verifies the loaded policy, workspace and outside-write behavior, and missing
profile failure before selecting it for dedicated Codex containers. Failure
rolls back the owned cluster; the state directory records nonsecret provenance.

Startup waits for the Gateway, certificate, and proxy Pods before reporting
success. Envoy source addresses must fall inside the selected node's Pod CIDR;
the tenant ingress policy must still admit only the Gateway's exact proxy peer.

The loopback development proxy also terminates browser HTTPS using a private
per-installation CA and a leaf limited to that installation's console and Agent
hosts. The API and browser NodePorts are published only to host loopback. The
bootstrap administrator password, service key, and CA private key remain in the
private state directory. Browser CA trust is an explicit operator action.

With repository inputs, startup creates the scoped broker after the initial
Namespace exists and waits for authenticated repository-option discovery. This
does not prove a model turn, native sandbox, or Git operation.

### 12. Select Kubernetes development and preserve cleanup ownership

`internal/occdev/command.go:selectEngine`,
`internal/occdev/command.go:pinEndpoint`,
`internal/occdev/command.go:podmanEndpoint`,
`internal/occdev/up.go:Up`.

Without a Sandbox Driver, Kubernetes startup selects Docker or Podman and
resolves its host socket from Docker's active context or `podman machine inspect`.
Private state records the socket, Compose project, and `occ-dev-*` cluster.
Cleanup validates and reuses those records, regardless of later context changes.

Startup refuses existing cluster or project resources, validates the resolved
Compose publications through `internal/occdev/compose.go:AnalyzeCompose`, and
rejects external or unscoped networks and volumes through
`internal/occdev/up.go:validateResourceOwnership`. It then claims the state directory with an exclusive `0700` creation. It writes the
rendered Compose snapshot privately before creating resources.
`setKubernetesBridgeGateway` preserves an explicit development-network gateway
or derives the first usable address from its rendered subnet before saving the
snapshot. This supplies the bridge gateway k3d requires, including when the
operator overrides the subnet. Startup and
cleanup both use that snapshot, so later `.env` edits cannot change the saved
project configuration.

With `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_CONTROL_PLANE=kubernetes`, Kubernetes Compute branches
before Compose rendering into
`internal/occdev/openshell_k3d.go:upK3d`. That profile uses the engine
only for k3d and image operations, and adds OpenShell only when selected.
Without OpenShell, the Installation selects the bundled Presets and curated
Codex Plugin Driver. Startup copies the generated administrator password and
service key into the private state directory.

When repository inputs are selected, `internal/occdev/repository_k3d.go` first
validates their private directory, explicit Namespace placeholder, profiles, App
key, and approved egress IPv4 `/32` endpoints. After authenticated bootstrap and Namespace
readiness, it substitutes the server-assigned Namespace ID into the immutable
registry, generates a CA and exact-host certificate, creates separate Kubernetes
inputs, and upgrades Helm with the selected Repo Driver and worker sidecar.
Startup compares authenticated repository discovery with the approved references
and profiles. It does not perform Git operations; see the
[local repository procedure](../../guides/deploy/local-repository-credentials.md).

The default `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_CONTROL_PLANE=compose` continues through the
Compose snapshot and startup sequence. An unsupported control-plane value fails
before resource creation. The
[OpenShell provisioning flow](../openshell-sandbox-provisioning.md#0-create-the-development-control-plane)
owns both OpenShell control-plane sequences.

### 13. Bootstrap OCC, create k3d, and prepare runtime configuration

`internal/occdev/up.go:Up`, `internal/occdev/up.go:waitCompleted`,
`internal/occdev/kubernetes.go:writeKubeconfigs`,
`internal/occdev/kubernetes.go:importRuntime`,
`internal/occdev/kubernetes.go:writeInstallation`,
`internal/occdev/openshell.go:prepareOpenShell`.

Compose starts PostgreSQL, migration, and bootstrap; successful migration and
bootstrap exits precede dedicated k3d cluster creation on the Compose network.
With the default Sandbox profile, `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_K3S_IMAGE` selects the node
image; its default `+v1.35` resolves the latest K3s 1.35 patch. An explicit
image skips lookup. OpenShell uses its pinned image in both control-plane modes.
The cluster API binds host loopback; creation leaves the default kubeconfig and
current context unchanged.

The host kubeconfig remains owner-readable. The container kubeconfig uses the
cluster's internal load-balancer hostname with TLS verification. The lifecycle
imports the runtime and OpenShell images under engine-recorded names, including
Podman's `localhost/` tags and Docker Hub's familiar names. For an omitted tag,
`internal/occdev/kubernetes.go:engineImageReference` matches `:latest`; it
rejects missing or ambiguous matches. It then resolves the in-cluster digest and
writes Installation configuration selecting Kubernetes Compute, Configuration,
and Secret Drivers with native IAM. Without OpenShell, it includes both bundled
Presets and the Codex Plugin Driver after the shared Codex sandbox check.
Its runtime section configures the transport
Secret prefix and gateway storage class accepted by the current Compute Driver
schema. Generated memory limits are 3 GiB per Gateway and 2 GiB per Harness.
The container configuration and kubeconfig are individually readable by
non-root containers, behind the private host directory, and mounted read-only
into the API and Kubernetes worker. Neither service receives the engine socket.

When Compose mode also selects OpenShell, startup installs the pinned Agent
Sandbox controller and OpenShell Gateway in k3d before starting the API and
worker. The Gateway uses `openshell-system` and a fixed NodePort reachable from
the private Compose network. Sandbox Driver configuration selects operator
workspace mode and includes rendered workspace-chart resources that
`ensureNamespace` applies for each OCC Namespace.

### 14. Prove readiness and clean up the owned Kubernetes profile

`internal/occdev/up.go:waitReady`, `internal/occdev/up.go:copyAndVerifyKey`,
`internal/occdev/down.go:Down`, `internal/occdev/down.go:cleanup`,
`internal/occdev/state.go:readState`.

Startup starts the API and Kubernetes worker, waits for API health and worker
readiness, copies bootstrap output to a private temporary file, and reads the
Installation with `occclient`. Its ID must match the bootstrap response before
the final key file is written exclusively. With OpenShell, startup waits for the
bootstrap Kubernetes Namespace and for OCC to report it ready, proving the
Sandbox Driver created or adopted its operator-mode Workspace.

Both Kubernetes profiles pass `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to
`k3d cluster create --timeout`. A node that never becomes ready therefore returns
failure instead of leaving the launcher waiting indefinitely.

On failure, startup attempts resource cleanup. Explicit Kubernetes shutdown
validates the marker, state, and Compose snapshot before using the recorded
engine endpoint. Cleanup stops the API and worker before deleting the named
k3d cluster and Compose project volumes. It continues cleanup after individual
errors and retains state when any cleanup step fails. Complete cleanup removes
the state directory and its helper-owned key. A successfully returned external
`--key-output` file remains operator-owned; startup removes a newly written
external key if a later OpenShell readiness step fails.

## Debugging and Verification

- `node --test tests/integration/dev-up.test.mjs` exercises profile selection,
  generated configuration, authenticated readiness, rollback, and cleanup with
  inert external engine and cluster commands.
- `OCC_TEST_DEV_UP_OPENSHELL_REAL=1 node --test tests/integration/dev-up-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs`
  selects the Kubernetes-only real-cluster proof.
- `OCC_TEST_DEV_UP_OPENSHELL_COMPOSE_REAL=1 node --test tests/integration/dev-up-openshell-k3d-real.test.mjs`
  selects the Compose-backed real-cluster proof.
- A successful startup does not prove Agent creation, model credentials, or a
  model turn. Follow the owning runtime integration procedure for those claims.
