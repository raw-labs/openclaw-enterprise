# Configure Agent channels and credentials

These are the **Channels** and **Credentials** tabs of the [Agent detail page](agent-details.md). Changes on both tabs apply only after **Deploy new version**.

## Channels tab

The Slack card shows **Not configured**, **Disabled**, or
**Configured (enabled)** based on saved settings: Socket Mode, selected channels, and allowed users. This is not a
live connection indicator.

Version cards are read-only. On the new version draft, **Configure Slack** or **Edit Slack**
opens a drawer; **Disable Slack** saves a disabled channel setting. These changes affect
future deployments, including other Agents sharing that Configuration. They do
not stop a running channel or modify an existing version. Channels require
Dedicated execution; unsupported native settings can make the simple editor
unavailable.

| **Enable Slack**                                                        | Enables Slack in the draft when saved.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Slack bot token** / **Slack app token**                               | Search readable Secrets by name or ID, then select with arrow keys and Enter, or choose **Create new Secret...**. The bot token Secret also enables name search below.                                          |
| **Create new Secret...**                                                | Opens a modal with an editable Name (the Agent name and token by default), the fixed binding key, and a masked Value.                                                                                           |
| **View bot token Secret metadata** / **View app token Secret metadata** | Opens the selected Secret's metadata in a new tab, keeping unsaved drawer inputs.                                                                                                                               |
| **Channels**                                                            | Search channels by name with the bot token Secret, or paste exact channel IDs. Existing properties of retained channels are preserved.                                                                          |
| **Who can use the agent in these channels?**                            | **Specific people** limits mentions to **Allowed people in these channels**; **Everyone in these channels** allows any Slack user there. Direct-message access is separate.                                     |
| **Allowed people in these channels**                                    | Slack users, by name search or exact user ID, who may mention the Agent in the selected channels.                                                                                                               |
| **Require a mention**                                                   | Applies the mention requirement to the listed channels.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Direct-message policy**                                               | **Pairing** (approve new senders), **Allowlist** (selected users only, the default for a new setup), **Open** (anyone) or **Disabled**. An existing setup without a policy shows **Runtime default (pairing)**. |
| **Allowed people in direct messages**                                   | Users allowed to send direct messages under Allowlist, or preapproved under Pairing. Allowlist needs at least one.                                                                                              |
| **Save configuration**                                                  | Saves channel settings and selected Secret bindings to the shared draft.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Cancel** / **Close**                                                  | Discards the drawer's unsaved inputs.                                                                                                                                                                           |

Name search needs a reachable Slack directory; when it is unavailable, the drawer says so and
exact IDs still work. Channel access and direct-message access are independent:
channel people edit the selected channels' `users`. Switching to **Open** writes
`allowFrom: ["*"]`, Pairing or Allowlist write the listed people to `allowFrom`, and Disabled
keeps the saved list. Save channel edits before changing
credentials on the Credentials tab.
See [Slack setup](../integrations/slack.md) for credentials and policy details.

In any Secret picker, typing a Secret's exact name selects it when you press
Enter or leave the field, as choosing its suggestion does; other text restores
the bound Secret.

**Create Secret** stores the value immediately. Cancelling the channel drawer
discards token selections but does not delete that Namespace Secret. The modal
never reads an existing value. If the name already exists in this Namespace,
correct the Name and retry; both fields remain filled and the existing Secret is unchanged.
See the [Console reference](../../reference/console.md#inspect-detail-revisions-and-channel-drafts)
for binding permissions and save behavior. Apply the saved draft with
**Deploy new version** before expecting the running Agent to use it.

For Microsoft Teams, configure app and tenant IDs, select or create the app
password Secret, and choose channel and personal-message access in the Teams
editor. Follow [Teams setup](../integrations/teams.md) for the required public
callback listener and Microsoft app registration. A missing password binding
blocks console deployment. Advanced native shapes remain inspectable through
Configuration JSON.

## Credentials tab

### Harness authentication

**Authentication source** determines how the harness gets model credentials:

| Choice                           | Required input and effect                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **None**                         | No binding; deployment remains blocked.                                                                           |
| **API key**                      | Select a Namespace Secret containing the API key, or create one through the picker.                               |
| **Service Accounts**             | Select a Namespace Secret containing a service account token; available for the Codex Harness.                    |
| **ChatGPT OAuth (Experimental)** | Codex Harness only: sign in through a device code; see [credential lifecycle](../deploy/credential-lifecycle.md). |
| **Operator-managed credentials** | Credentials configured on the runtime host; OCC does not validate them.                                           |
| **ChatGPT service account**      | Select an already issued account in this Namespace. This selector does not create an account.                     |

**Save authentication source** saves the Agent binding for a future deployment.
For API keys and Service Accounts tokens, it also grants the Agent access to
that exact Secret through your authorized Namespace IAM operations. If the
binding saves but the grant fails, ask a Namespace administrator to confirm
`secret:operate` for this Agent on that Secret, then use **Retry credential
access**. The retry checks the saved binding and does not resave it. If the
binding changed, or the save outcome is unknown, use **Reload authentication source** first.
Deployment authorization failures remain visible beside **Deploy new version**;
check both your deployment permission and the Agent's credential access.
Changing between **API key** and **Service Accounts** clears the selected Secret
so a token is not silently reused for another authentication method. The account
availability message describes discovery, not model readiness.
See [harness authentication](../../reference/harness-execution.md#harness-authentication).

### Channel Secrets

This section appears when Slack is enabled in the saved Configuration.

| Component                                         | Purpose                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slack app token / bot token: Bound/Missing**    | Reports saved Secret references, not whether Slack accepts the tokens.                                           |
| **Slack app token** / **Slack bot token** pickers | Select a readable Namespace Secret or **Create new Secret...**. Missing tokens need a selected binding.          |
| **Save channel Secrets**                          | Saves Configuration Secret bindings, grants the Agent access, and requires an explicit deployment to apply them. |

First-deployment credential generation requires Agent `read` and `operate` when
generated credentials are missing; deployment also requires `deploy`.
Saving channel Secrets additionally requires Secret,
Configuration, and Namespace IAM permissions. These are multiple writes, so a
failure can leave partial progress. **Outcome unknown** means refresh and inspect
saved state before retrying. Save requires at least one changed selection and a
bound Secret for each token. Changing the picker switches the referenced Secret;
it does not overwrite an existing shared Secret value. Existing values are never
fetched or displayed.
