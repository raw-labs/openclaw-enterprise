# Breaking-change notices

OpenClaw Enterprise (OCE) is pre-alpha and has no stable release, so a newer
main can refuse or break an Installation that an older build created. Each
change like that gets an entry here: what breaks, who is affected, how to tell,
and the steps. Before an upgrade, read every entry dated after the source commit
you run now, then follow the [upgrade checklist](upgrade-checklist.md) and
[production image upgrades](production-upgrade.md).

Entries are newest first. Steps marked _untested_ have not been run against a
real Installation.

## 2026-10-09: sandbox domains longer than 214 characters are refused

**What breaks.** Since #1823, Helm refuses a `gatewayRouting.sandbox.domain`
over 214 characters (`must not exceed 214 characters, leaving room for the
agent-<32 hex>. prefix`), and the controller refuses to start with
`Sandbox domain must not exceed 214 characters`. Each dedicated Agent hostname,
`agent-<32 hex>.<domain>`, must fit the 253-character Gateway API limit.

**Who is affected.** Installations with sandbox routing and a 215-253 character
domain. Their dedicated Agent preview routes were already refused at deploy.

**How to tell.**
`helm get values <release> -o json | jq '.gatewayRouting.sandbox.domain // "" | length'`
prints more than 214.

**Steps.** Pick a shorter preview domain, issue its wildcard certificate and
DNS, set the new domain, then upgrade.

## 2026-10-07: migration 0049 refuses managed ChatGPT service-account Agents

**What breaks.** Since #1648 (`94957cedc`), migration
`0049_codex_pat_sources` stops the upgrade with SQLSTATE `23514`
(`Unsupported legacy managed PAT authentication`) when any Agent, Agent
revision or queued provisioning request still uses the retired
`chatgpt_service_account` Harness auth. The method is now `codex_pat` with a
service-account source. The old release keeps running; nothing is changed.

**Who is affected.** Installations that ever deployed an Agent with
`harnessAuth.method` `chatgpt_service_account`, including Agents since changed
to another method, because their old revisions keep it.

**How to tell.** Before upgrading, on the old release:

```bash
occ agent list -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.harnessAuth.method == "chatgpt_service_account") | .id'
```

Run it in every Namespace (`--namespace`). An Agent changed away from the method
still has old revisions; check them with
`GET /namespaces/<id>/agents/<agent>/revisions`.

**Steps.** Deleting an Agent removes its revisions and provisioning requests,
which clears the refusal.

1. Record each affected Agent's settings (`occ agent get <id> -o json`) and
   workspace files.
2. Delete it on the old release (`occ agent delete <id>`) and wait until
   `occ agent list` no longer shows it.
3. Upgrade.
4. Re-create the Agent with
   `"harnessAuth": {"method": "codex_pat", "source": {"kind": "service_account", "namespaceId": "<ns>", "id": "<sa>"}}`,
   then deploy it.

_Untested_ on a real Installation. The split-layout script below does steps 1, 2
and 4 for every Agent it moves.

## 2026-10-05: split-layout tenants block the controller upgrade

**What breaks.** Since #925 (`dd344a97c`), a single-cluster Installation keeps
each Namespace's Gateways and Harnesses in one tenant namespace. Releases before
it kept Gateways in a separate `oce-gateways-<hash>` namespace. The current API
and worker refuse to start while such a namespace exists, and the
[image upgrade helper](production-upgrade.md) stops at its startup preflight
(`Existing split-layout Gateway storage prevents this single-cluster upgrade`)
before it changes anything. See
[split-layout installations](../../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute.md#existing-split-layout-installations).

**Who is affected.** Single-cluster Installations created by the 2026-09-28
release, or by any main before `dd344a97c`, with at least one Namespace.
Bootstrap creates `default`, so that is nearly all of them. The experimental
two-cluster profile is not affected.

**How to tell.**

```bash
kubectl get namespaces -l openclaw.dev/gateway-namespace -L openclaw.dev/namespace
```

A row with an empty `NAMESPACE` column is a split-layout tenant.

**What you lose.** No migration moves the old namespaces, so their tenants are
exported, deleted and re-created under new IDs. A deleted Namespace's name stays
reserved, so each Namespace comes back under a new name. These come back:
Secrets (you supply the values again), Configurations that an Agent uses,
Presets, credential sources, Roles, access bindings, service accounts (without
issued credentials) and Agents. Agents that were running are deployed again,
and a copy of each running Agent's Harness workspace can be put back. These do
not come back:

- chat history and other Gateway state (the copy keeps the transcripts for
  reference; loading them into the new Gateway is untested);
- Agent revision history and bindings to old revisions;
- group, Installation-wide and resource-less bindings (re-create them by hand);
- issued service-account credentials and Agent runtime credentials;
- the old IDs and Namespace names, so update anything outside OCE that uses them.

Accounts, Installation service keys and the audit history stay in the database.

**Steps.** Tested on a 2026-09-28 release Installation with three Namespaces
and three Agents: the commands took about two minutes, plus the two image
releases (about 35 seconds each). Run them from a checkout of the target
release, with `occ` set up for the old release as an administrator (`OCC_URL`,
`OCC_SERVICE_KEY_FILE`, `OCC_CA_BUNDLE`) and `kubectl` for the cluster. The
script talks to OCC only. Keep every file below private: they hold
Configurations, workspace files, transcripts and Secret values.

1. Export every Namespace from the old release:

   ```bash
   node scripts/split-layout-tenants.mjs export --out /secure/occ/tenants.json
   ```

   It reads `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md` and `USER.md` only where
   [workspace routing](workspace-routing.md) is configured and the Agent runs.
   Step 2 copies the whole workspace instead.

2. Copy each running Agent's Harness workspace and Gateway state:

   ```bash
   ARCHIVE=/secure/occ/tenant-archive
   mkdir -m 700 -p "$ARCHIVE"
   kubectl get pods -A -l openclaw.dev/agent --field-selector status.phase=Running -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace} {.metadata.name} {.metadata.labels.openclaw\.dev/workload-role} {.metadata.labels.openclaw\.dev/agent}{"\n"}{end}' |
   while read -r ns pod role agent; do
     case $role in
       gateway) paths='.openclaw/state .openclaw/agents/main/agent .openclaw/media .openclaw/agents/main/sessions' ;;
       agent) paths='workspace .codex/generated_images' ;;
       *) continue ;;
     esac
     kubectl -n "$ns" exec "$pod" -c "$role" -- tar -C /home/node --ignore-failed-read \
       --exclude=codex-home --exclude='.oce-workspace-setup.*' -cf - $paths \
       >"$ARCHIVE/$agent-$role.tar" </dev/null || echo "failed: $agent $role"
   done
   ```

3. Write the Secret values to a `0600` file such as
   `/secure/occ/tenant-secrets.json`, keyed by the old Namespace name, then
   Secret name: `{"team-a": {"model-key": "..."}}`. List the names with
   `jq '.namespaces[] | {name, secrets: [.secrets[].name]}' /secure/occ/tenants.json`.
4. Delete the tenants on the old release. The command refuses if a Namespace
   gained an Agent or Secret after the export, or if the export could not read an
   Agent's workspace files; once step 2 has the copy, add
   `--allow-unread-workspace-files`:

   ```bash
   node scripts/split-layout-tenants.mjs discard --bundle /secure/occ/tenants.json \
     --yes --allow-unread-workspace-files
   kubectl get namespaces -l openclaw.dev/gateway-namespace
   ```

   Continue when no `oce-gateways-*` namespace is left. A Configuration that no
   Agent uses is not exported and blocks its Namespace's delete; the error says
   how to find and delete it. Then run `discard` again.

5. [Upgrade the control plane](production-upgrade.md#upgrade-the-control-plane)
   and the runtime as usual. The preflight now passes.
6. Re-create the tenants under new Namespace names. `--skip` leaves out a
   Namespace you no longer need, such as an unused `default`:

   ```bash
   node scripts/split-layout-tenants.mjs import --bundle /secure/occ/tenants.json \
     --secret-values /secure/occ/tenant-secrets.json --map /secure/occ/tenant-ids.json \
     --rename team-a=team-a-2 --skip default
   ```

   It creates the Namespaces and exits `3` until they are `ready`.
   [Grant tenant RoleBindings](production-agents.md#grant-tenant-rolebindings)
   for each one, then run the same command again. The ID map records every old
   and new ID, so a rerun after any failure resumes. Exit `4` lists what needs a
   hand: Agents whose deploy failed, such as a service-account Agent without an
   issued credential, and access bindings it could not re-create.

7. Put each Harness workspace back once the new Agent's Harness Pod runs:

   ```bash
   for tarball in "$ARCHIVE"/*-agent.tar; do
     old=$(basename "$tarball" -agent.tar)
     new=$(jq -r --arg old "$old" '.ids[$old] // empty' /secure/occ/tenant-ids.json)
     [ -n "$new" ] || { echo "skipped: $old was not imported"; continue; }
     read -r ns pod < <(kubectl get pods -A --field-selector status.phase=Running \
       -l "openclaw.dev/agent=$new,openclaw.dev/workload-role=agent" \
       -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.namespace} {.items[0].metadata.name}')
     [ -n "${pod:-}" ] || { echo "skipped: $new has no running Harness"; continue; }
     kubectl -n "$ns" exec -i "$pod" -c agent -- tar -C /home/node --no-overwrite-dir -xf - <"$tarball" \
       && echo "restored $old -> $new" || echo "failed: $old -> $new"
   done
   ```

8. Check the Agents (`occ agent list`) and re-issue any service-account
   credentials.

## 2026-10-01: released dedicated Agents fail to redeploy

**What breaks.** Since `7e831ba37`, the dedicated Harness init container makes
its `workspace` and `generated-images` directories private (`0700`). Agents
deployed by the 2026-09-28 release have those directories owned by root, so on
the first redeploy the init container fails with `EPERM` and the Harness stays
in `Init:Error`. The upgrade helper's runtime step redeploys every running Agent.

**Who is affected.** Installations whose dedicated Agents were deployed by the
2026-09-28 release and are redeployed by a controller from `7e831ba37` up to,
but not including, #1652 (`42c43fcd0`, 2026-10-09).

**How to tell.** The Harness Pod's `prepare-private-state` container exits with
`EPERM: operation not permitted, chmod '/harness-workspace-state/workspace'`.

**Steps.** Upgrade the controller to `42c43fcd0` or later, then deploy the
Agent again (`occ agent deploy <id>`). The init container moves each old
directory aside, recreates it as uid 1000 with mode `0700` and moves the files
back. Entries it cannot move back are left in `.workspace.kubelet-created` or
`.generated-images.kubelet-created` beside it and named in the init log.
