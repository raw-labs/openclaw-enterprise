# Deploy native admin UI access

Enable OpenClaw access through OCC with an explicit runtime assignment for each person. The selected native role determines their permissions. Use a runtime built from the [patched image recipe](../../../deploy/runtime/README.md); the stock source pin cannot accept OCE role assignments. For a local installation, use [local development](#local-development) below. For an existing cluster, start with [production installation](production-installation.md) and [private Agent workspace routing](workspace-routing.md).

## Existing Agents

Existing Agent `administer` grants and sharing bindings do not automatically assign an OpenClaw role. After updating OCC, those accounts cannot open OpenClaw until an Installation administrator assigns each person a configured role, including the administrator's own account.

1. Use the patched runtime image and [configure the Agent](#configure-each-agent) with named `gateway.roles.definitions` and a `gateway.roles.default` naming one of them. Deploy the new version and wait for it to become active. The Kubernetes Driver configures the trusted-proxy role headers.
2. Open **Share Agent**, enter the person's Principal ID, and select their OpenClaw role.
3. Sign in as that person and open **Open OpenClaw**. An `administer` grant alone no longer grants entry; each person needs exact Agent `use` permission and a runtime assignment.

## Local development

Local setup prepares private routing and the browser endpoint. To opt a selected
Agent into native admin access:

1. [Create and deploy an Agent](../../reference/console/create-and-deploy.md) in the
   console, for example with the Standard Codex Preset. Wait for its active
   version. Deploy named `gateway.roles` first, then use **Share Agent** to assign the account an explicit OpenClaw role on that exact Agent.
2. In the authenticated console session, follow [Configure each Agent](native-admin.md#configure-each-agent)
   to obtain the exact `data.origin` and active revision ID from the status
   route. Include the returned port; do not construct or reuse another Agent's
   origin. An `unsupported` response can include the origin. If OCC cannot
   select an active revision, resolve that first.
3. Use **Create new version** → **Configuration** → **Edit Configuration** to
   merge the documented native policy and origin into the existing JSON. Review
   other Agents that share the Configuration: they use its new values on their
   next deployment. Preserve existing origins, gateway settings, and Secret
   references. Resolve explicit opt-outs or conflicting policy before changing
   them; do not silently replace them. Recheck the active revision before saving;
   if it changed, refresh and review the current Configuration again.
4. Save the Configuration and select **Deploy new version**. Once it is active,
   request status again and expect `available` with the same origin. Open
   **OpenClaw** on the Agent detail page. For stale drafts or uncertain
   saves, follow the [Configuration editor recovery](../console/agent-details.md#configuration-tab).

The [first-Agent command](../first-agent.md) creates a separate Agent with native UI
disabled and refuses to reuse it after outside Configuration edits. Create a
console-managed Agent for this native admin walkthrough.

## Production requirements

- Private workspace routing already works for the target Agents. Helm rejects `agentNativeAdmin.enabled: true` unless `gatewayRouting.enabled: true` is also set.
- A public wildcard DNS name and HTTPS certificate route traffic to the OCC API Service, not to Envoy. Use a previously unused `agentNativeAdmin.domain` for the first pilot rollout; do not reuse a domain from prior native UI experiments because OCC does not evict already registered browser service workers.
- The configured Agent domain is separate from the console host and does not include a wildcard, scheme, port, or path.
- The configured `agentNativeAdmin.sharedCookieDomain` is the shared OCE session cookie parent domain. The console host and Agent domain must both be inside it on DNS-label boundaries, for example `console.oce.example.com`, `agents.oce.example.com`, and cookie domain `oce.example.com`. All matching subdomains that can receive the OCE session cookie must be trusted OCE ingress endpoints.
- Each pilot Agent uses native trusted-proxy authentication with `occ-workspace-files` granted `operator.admin`, native `controlUi.enabled: true`, the derived Agent origin in `controlUi.allowedOrigins`, and trusted-proxy admin device auto-approval.
- Operators who use the console have exact Agent `use` permission with an explicit runtime-role assignment.

## Install on an existing cluster

The standard production values enable this feature. Replace their example domains
with your reviewed domains and keep these values alongside private gateway routing:

```yaml
gatewayRouting:
  enabled: true

agentNativeAdmin:
  enabled: true
  domain: agents.oce.example.com
  sharedCookieDomain: oce.example.com
```

Expose the API Service through your existing public ingress layer. The chart does not create this route. This example shows the required shape; adapt the Ingress class, certificate, and selectors to your cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: occ-agent-native-admin
  namespace: openclaw-system
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: public-wildcard
spec:
  ingressClassName: public
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "*.agents.oce.example.com"
      secretName: occ-agent-native-admin-wildcard-tls
  rules:
    - host: "*.agents.oce.example.com"
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: openclaw-enterprise-api
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

The API refuses protected requests carrying `X-Forwarded-*` or `X-Real-IP`
headers, which ingress-nginx adds, unless the sender is a trusted proxy: set
[`api.trustedProxy`](../../reference/settings/production.md#github-sign-in-and-trusted-proxies)
to preset `ingress-nginx` with the ingress-nginx Pod CIDR (profile installs:
[`controlPlane.trustedProxy`](installation-profiles.md#external-sign-in-and-trusted-proxies)),
or strip those headers at the ingress.

Allow ingress only to the API Pods selected for public browser traffic. Keep the Envoy Service private:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-native-admin-browser-ingress-to-api
  namespace: openclaw-system
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: openclaw-enterprise
      app.kubernetes.io/component: api
  policyTypes: ["Ingress"]
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: ingress-nginx
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
```

Verify Helm passes these API environment variables:

```text
OCC_AGENT_NATIVE_ADMIN_ENABLED=true
OCC_AGENT_NATIVE_ADMIN_DOMAIN=agents.oce.example.com
OCC_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN=oce.example.com
```

Verify that the Better Auth session cookie is emitted once at the shared domain
with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and the configured `SameSite` behavior. On HTTPS,
the shared cookie name is `__Secure-openclaw_occ_shared.session_token`; it cannot
use a host-only `__Host-` prefix because it has a `Domain` attribute. Sign in
again after changing an existing installation to the shared-cookie scope so OCC
can clear old host-only `openclaw_occ` and `openclaw_occ_shared` session-cookie
names before testing Agent hosts. If `agentNativeAdmin.enabled` is false, OCC
ignores the shared cookie-domain value and keeps the legacy host-only
`openclaw_occ` session cookie behavior.

Kubernetes Compute renders baseline gateway trust from Installation settings.
Native admin availability still checks the explicit Agent policy below; keep
its matching identity fields and opt-in settings in the saved Configuration.

## Configure each Agent

Configure each Agent after the API feature and wildcard route are enabled. First deploy `gateway.roles` and assign your existing Principal ID through **Share Agent**. Without that assignment, the status endpoint returns `403`, including for Installation administrators. Kubernetes adds the trusted role headers and reserved service role; retain canonical native role definitions in OCE. Native admin availability requires the Agent's native configuration to trust the exact derived Agent origin. In an existing authenticated console browser session, open the status URL before the final compatible redeploy:

```text
https://occ.example.com/namespaces/<namespaceId>/agents/<agentId>/native-admin
```

For browser devtools, the same check is:

```js
await fetch("/namespaces/<namespaceId>/agents/<agentId>/native-admin", {
  credentials: "include",
}).then((response) => response.json());
```

A `200` response with `data.status: "unsupported"` can still include `data.host`, `data.origin`, `data.activeRevisionId`, and `data.url`. Copy the exact returned `data.origin`, including any port. In the [console Configuration editor](../console/agent-details.md#configuration-tab), merge the following JSON fields into the selected Agent's existing Configuration:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "publicOrigin": "https://agent-<opaque-hash>.agents.oce.example.com",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "trusted-proxy",
      "trustedProxy": {
        "userHeader": "x-occ-identity",
        "allowUsers": [],
        "deviceAutoApprove": {
          "enabled": true,
          "scopes": ["operator.read", "operator.write", "operator.admin"]
        }
      },
      "identityScopes": {
        "occ-workspace-files": ["operator.admin"]
      }
    },
    "roles": {
      "default": "reviewer",
      "definitions": {
        "reviewer": {
          "sessions": { "others": "view" },
          "agents": ["main"],
          "scopes": ["operator.read"]
        },
        "administrator": {
          "sessions": { "others": "write" },
          "agents": "*",
          "scopes": ["operator.admin"]
        }
      }
    },
    "controlUi": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowedOrigins": ["https://agent-<opaque-hash>.agents.oce.example.com"]
    }
  }
}
```

Device auto-approval must include the scopes used by each assigned role. It approves the device; the assigned role still limits the person's permissions.

Keep existing model, Harness, channel, gateway, Secret reference, and allowed origin settings. Add the exact origin to any existing allowed origins. `publicOrigin` is optional for native admin access: set it to the same origin so links the Agent returns, such as embedded Diffs viewer links, open through this Agent host instead of the Gateway's private address. Review any other Agents sharing this Configuration before saving; they use its new values on their next deployment. Resolve explicitly disabled UI or device approval and conflicting authentication policy with the Configuration owner instead of silently overwriting them. The editor preserves Secret bindings, but its freshness check cannot prevent a concurrent write racing with the save.

Do not set unsupported gateway authentication fields, `controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth`, or `controlUi.dangerouslyAllowHostHeaderOriginFallback`. Deploy the updated Agent revision, then call the status route again and expect `data.status: "available"` with the same `data.origin`. For `stopped` or `unavailable`, follow the [troubleshooting checks](#troubleshooting) before changing configuration.

Keep durable configuration changes in OCE. For compatible Kubernetes gateways,
native edits affect a Pod-local copy and are discarded when the Pod is replaced
or the Agent is redeployed; persistent workspace and gateway data remain.
See [Kubernetes managed native configuration](../../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/storage-and-credentials.md#managed-native-configuration)
for the exact opt-in conditions and storage lifecycle.

## Enable HTML previews

HTML previews use the runtime's separate sandbox listener. Exposing the native
admin UI alone does not expose this listener: without sandbox routing, the browser
may try the Agent hostname on port 8081 and report a refused connection.

Provision a wildcard HTTPS certificate and DNS for a separate preview domain,
for example `*.previews.example.net`. This domain must be outside
`agentNativeAdmin.sharedCookieDomain`; it must not receive OCE session cookies.
Store the wildcard certificate in a TLS Secret in the Helm release namespace.
Enable a separate Envoy listener with explicit public ingress peers:

```yaml
gatewayRouting:
  sandbox:
    enabled: true
    domain: previews.example.net
    tlsSecretName: preview-wildcard
    listenerPort: 8443
    ingressPeers:
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: ingress-nginx
        podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
```

Route the preview wildcard through your ingress to the Envoy Service's sandbox
port, preserving the requested hostname and TLS server name. Keep the private
administrative listener restricted. `listenerPort` is also the Envoy Pod port;
it must be at least 1024 and differ from the private Envoy HTTPS target port.
For local testing, a loopback port-forward to that Service port can provide the
same TLS endpoint; normal certificate validation must succeed.

In the Installation's `drivers.compute.configuration.gatewayRouting`, add:

```yaml
sandbox:
  domain: previews.example.net
  publicPort: 443
```

The domain must match Helm. `publicPort` is the browser-facing HTTPS port and
may differ from Envoy's listener port; it defaults to 443. Restart the API and
worker after changing startup configuration, then deploy the Agent normally.
Compute derives each Agent's hostname, renders `mcp.apps.sandboxOrigin` and
`sandboxPort`, and creates its Service and route. New Agents need no manual
hostname mapping. Remove conflicting tenant overrides of those two native
fields rather than redirecting the sandbox to the admin origin.

Open a generated HTML file from the native chat. Verify it renders on the preview
domain, the request carries no OCE session cookie, and the preview host cannot
serve `/console/`, Gateway RPCs or workspace data. A successful shell request
alone does not prove the file rendered. After replacing the Gateway Pod, reopen
the same file and verify its contents are retained.

## Tests

Open the console, choose a running Agent with an active revision, open **Workspace files**, and verify **Native admin UI** reports available for an administrator. Open the tab and confirm the Agent host loads without native-admin exchange, bootstrap, callback, or Agent-specific session-cookie requests.

Full runtime proof still requires a real browser test that loads native assets through OCC, reconnects native WebSocket traffic, verifies the OCE session cookie never reaches the native gateway, and performs a reversible native admin edit against a disposable Agent.
