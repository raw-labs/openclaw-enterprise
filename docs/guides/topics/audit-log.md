# Audit log

OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC) records audit events for Installation bootstrap,
successful resource changes, authorization denials, and lifecycle completion,
such as activating an Agent revision. Audit events are stored in the
controller’s PostgreSQL database. Routine operational logs and the OpenTelemetry
Collector do not export or replace this record.

## What is recorded

An event identifies when it occurred, the Installation, actor, action, affected
resource, and outcome. It can also include a Namespace, request ID, or
authorization decision when available. For example, service API key issuance and
revocation record the administrator and the non-secret key and principal IDs,
not the credential. The audit event contract does not represent a general log of
all successful reads, Agent prompts, or model responses.

The controller worker records a `reconcile` event when queued work changes
state: each retry, permanent failure, expired claim, and completion. A pass that
leaves work waiting, such as a deployment whose runtime is still starting, is
recorded only when its result differs from the work item's previous one, so a
deployment that waits for minutes writes one waiting event, not one per check.
Authorization denials and lifecycle events such as revision activation are
always recorded.

Reading an Agent's container output is the exception among reads. Each
[runtime log view](agent-logs.md) records one `openclaw.agents.runtime_logs.view`
event before any output is read, with the version, source, Pod, container,
previous-instance flag, line count and a view ID, never the log text. Follow
polls within the view are not recorded again; a poll that has to read another
Pod, because the view's Pod is gone, records a new view. If the event cannot be written,
no output is returned. Each log download records one
`openclaw.agents.runtime_logs.download` event with the same details, before the
read. Both use the audit event kind `access`, which marks an audited read; other
events use `bootstrap`, `mutation` or `authorization_denial`. The event names
the permission that admitted the reader, `read_logs` or `administer`. Runtime
status reads are not audited.

## Access and limitations

OCC does not currently provide a console view or public HTTP API to browse or
export audit events. Configurable audit retention and export integrations are
also not implemented. If you need to investigate an event, give your platform
operator the approximate time, Namespace, resource ID, and OCC request ID if
available. Use your organization’s approved database access procedure; there is
no self-service retrieval workflow in OCC.
