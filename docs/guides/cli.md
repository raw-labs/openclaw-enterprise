# Set up the OCC CLI

<a id="occ-cli"></a>

Use `occ` to manage OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC) resources from a terminal. You
need your Installation's OCC endpoint and a protected service-key response file.
For all commands and flags, see the [CLI command reference](../reference/cli.md).
To deploy through the browser, see [Create and deploy Agents in the console](../reference/console/create-and-deploy.md).

## Connect to your Installation

For a published OCE version, download the binary matching your machine from
the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-enterprise/releases).
The assets are named `occ-v<version>-<os>-<arch>` for macOS (`darwin`) and Linux,
on `amd64` or `arm64`. Download `SHA256SUMS` from the same release and compare
the selected binary's SHA-256 before making it executable. For example, with
the GitHub CLI:

```bash
export OCE_VERSION='v<release-version>'
export OCC_ASSET="occ-${OCE_VERSION}-darwin-arm64" # Choose your OS and CPU.
gh release download "$OCE_VERSION" \
  --repo openclaw/openclaw-enterprise \
  --pattern "$OCC_ASSET" --pattern SHA256SUMS
expected="$(awk -v name="$OCC_ASSET" '$2 == name { print $1 }' SHA256SUMS)"
actual="$(shasum -a 256 "$OCC_ASSET" | awk '{ print $1 }')"
if [ -n "$expected" ] && [ "$actual" = "$expected" ]; then
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
  install -m 755 "$OCC_ASSET" "$HOME/.local/bin/occ"
  "$HOME/.local/bin/occ" --version
else
  printf 'OCC CLI checksum verification failed; binary not installed.\n' >&2
fi
```

Ensure `$HOME/.local/bin` is on `PATH`. On Linux, use
`sha256sum "$OCC_ASSET"` in place of `shasum -a 256` if `shasum` is not
installed. The printed CLI version should match the selected release.

To build from a trusted source checkout instead, run this from its root to
install `occ` on your Go binary path:

```bash
go install ./cmd/occ
```

Ensure that directory is on `PATH`. To use the binary inside the checkout
instead, run `pnpm cli:build` and substitute `./bin/occ` for `occ` below.
`occ dev up` and `occ dev down` still require a source checkout even when the
binary came from a GitHub Release.

Set the endpoint and the service-key file supplied by your administrator or
created during [bootstrap](../reference/authentication/service-api-keys.md#retrieve-the-bootstrap-service-key):

```bash
export OCC_URL='https://occ.example.com'
export OCC_SERVICE_KEY_FILE='/private/path/occ-service-key.json'
occ installation get
occ namespace list
```

`occ` has no human sign-in: a service key authenticates a non-Agent
ServicePrincipal, not a person. Without a key, use the
[console](../reference/console.md).

Replace both example values with your own. These commands require an
Installation-scoped key; reading the Installation also requires Installation
`read`. If your key is Namespace-scoped, use
`occ namespace get '<namespace-id>'` with the ID supplied by your administrator
instead.

`installation get` prints the Installation ID and name. `namespace list` prints
the authorized Namespaces and their `STATUS`; a Namespace must be `ready` to
deploy an Agent. Add `--output json` or `--output yaml` to print the resource or
list without the HTTP response envelope. Set a Namespace once for subsequent
commands:

```bash
export OCC_NAMESPACE='<namespace-id>'
```

## Give a member or automation CLI access

People sign in to the console; the CLI authenticates only with a service key.
An Installation administrator gives someone CLI access to one Namespace by
issuing a key for a Namespace service principal that holds only the grants
you bind. With an administrator key file and `OCC_NAMESPACE` set:

```bash
occ iam service-principal create -o json    # note its id: <service-principal-id>
occ iam access-binding create --file binding.json
occ service-key create --service-principal '<service-principal-id>' \
  --name nora-laptop --expires-in-days 30 --out nora-key.json
```

`binding.json` names the service principal as `subjectId` and an existing
Namespace Role; see [Namespace IAM](../reference/authorization.md#manage-namespace-policy).
Each binding grants one target, so bind the same targets a person would need, as in
[Let a person run an existing Agent](topics/iam.md#let-a-person-run-an-existing-agent).
Issuing the key requires that you already hold every grant of the service
principal. The key never reaches another Namespace, IAM policy, or key issuance. Hand over the `0600` key file privately; the member
sets `OCC_SERVICE_KEY_FILE` to it and `OCC_NAMESPACE` to the Namespace. When the
key is no longer needed, run `occ service-key revoke <key-id>` (the ID printed
at creation) or delete its AccessBindings. Disabling the member's console
account does not end the key, so revoke it when they leave.

## Connection and credential boundaries

The key file is the full JSON response from bootstrap or key issuance, not a
file containing only the raw key. Keep it owner-readable; never put the key in
command arguments, logs, or source control. For HTTPS signed by a private
certificate authority, set `OCC_CA_BUNDLE` to its PEM bundle. See
[global options](../reference/cli.md#global-options) for timeout, origin, and
TLS behavior.

## Troubleshoot

- `invalid service-key file`: Check that the JSON contains a nonempty
  `data.key` with no line break.
- HTTP `401`: OCC rejected the credential; retrieve or issue the intended key.
- HTTP `403`: Ask your administrator to check the service principal's permission
  for the exact operation and Namespace.
- Certificate error: Set `OCC_CA_BUNDLE` to the correct PEM bundle. The CLI has
  no insecure TLS mode.
