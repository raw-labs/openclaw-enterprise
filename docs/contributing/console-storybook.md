# Console Storybook

Console previews use in-memory fixtures. They contact no services and
run no workloads. Use dummy credentials.

## Run locally

From the repository root, with Node.js 24+ and the pinned pnpm version:

```sh
npm run storybook:install
npm run storybook
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:6006`. Stories have independent fixtures; **Reset story**
discards changes.

To build and serve a static copy:

```sh
npm run storybook:build
python3 -m http.server 6006 --bind 127.0.0.1 \
  --directory scripts/console-storybook/dist/site
```

Serve at the origin root for absolute `/console/` URLs. Build fingerprints keep
cached fixture pages and module imports current. CI uploads a static artifact
without publishing the documentation site.

## Appearance review

Use **Pages/Agents → Populated** to review the shared shell and controls at
desktop (1440 × 1000), tablet (768 × 1024), and mobile (390 × 844).
Check keyboard focus, search, navigation, an open dialog, and empty, loading,
error, permission-denied, and missing-credential stories. The console stays light
with either system appearance preference.

The Claw palette, type scale, and surface geometry reference
[OpenClaw `6e8d06876fd166064abbec4928fb3bb109ebe999`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/6e8d06876fd166064abbec4928fb3bb109ebe999/ui),
particularly `src/styles/base.css`, `layout.css`, and `components.css`.
OCE keeps its own navigation and workflows. Input borders are stronger than
the reference's decorative dividers so controls stay distinguishable. The
self-hosted Instrument Sans subset keeps its SIL Open Font License beside
the font; unsupported glyphs use the system fallback.

## Pages and components

Stories reach error states through real controls after loading fixture data.

| Group                   | Coverage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Workspace               | Four editable deployed files, undeployed Agent, denied reads, missing file, unknown write outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Stop Agent              | Confirmation, stopped requested state, permission denial, unknown outcome requiring refresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Pending-read stories use the real client's 15-second timeout; reset them to replay
loading.

In **Components/Native admin → Administrator Needs Assignment**, follow the
hint, assign the fixture Principal `platform-administrator` in Share Agent, then
select **Refresh access**. The launch link appears in the same tab. Compare
**Disabled and hidden** and **Denied and hidden**; neither shows the assignment
hint.

## Return navigation

Use **Pages/Navigation → Return to loaded pages** and **Return to Agent panels**.
Search, expanded configuration, native admin access, and Credentials should survive
Back/Forward and tab changes. Refresh reloads.

## Agent flows and UI gaps

In **Components → Navigation → Namespace switcher**, switch Engineering/Research
and check URL, collection, and Back behavior. **Mobile Namespace selector** checks
long names and direct switching. In **Mobile drawer**, widen past 760px while open:
Agents search must work without Escape. Shrink and check reopening and dismissal.
No-readable, unavailable, loading, and denied stories cover restrictions.

In **Pages → Namespaces → Unavailable selection**, recover inline and check the
URL, dismissed warning, unchanged page, and Back navigation. **Unavailable selection
mobile** repeats this at 390px; **Unavailable selection without access** shows access
guidance. Simulated examples:
[desktop](../assets/console-namespace-recovery/desktop.png),
[mobile](../assets/console-namespace-recovery/mobile.png),
[recovered](../assets/console-namespace-recovery/recovered.png),
[no access](../assets/console-namespace-recovery/no-access.png),
[walkthrough](../assets/console-namespace-recovery/walkthrough.webm),
[desktop selector](../assets/console-namespace-selector/desktop.png),
[mobile empty collection](../assets/console-namespace-selector/mobile.png),
[Namespaces page without a selector](../assets/console-namespace-selector/namespaces.png),
and a [switching walkthrough](../assets/console-namespace-selector/namespace-switching.webm).

### Create and deploy

Compare **New version queued**, **Deployment waiting for runtime**, and
**Deployment retry after dependency failure**; switch versions and check
**Since**.

**First deployment creates credentials** accepts **Deploy new version** without
a separate credential action. Its initial state is not a Stop request; OCC
generation is simulated.

Choose a Preset, fill variables, review seeded files, and create a Codex Agent.
The Console submits Configuration and Secret references, then simulates
provisioning. The default-Preset flow uses OpenAI Codex, a model Secret and model;
edit IDENTITY.md and clear USER.md before creation.
OpenClaw and unsupported-runtime stories keep the draft workflow: provision
credentials and deploy from Agent detail.

**Plugins Curated** exercises token-free discovery against simulated Driver responses,
leaving access unverified. Hosted discovery requires an eligible Codex
service-account token. Workspace and Standard OpenClaw stories preview file and
harness settings. Preset Secret stories cover existing, pending, denied, and
empty results while keeping new-token entry.

The [DevDay storyboard](../../scripts/console-storybook/devday-storyboard.md)
covers creating an Agent from the SWE Agent Preset and opening `oceclaw`'s
simulated Admin UI, with expected states and fallbacks.

**Choose provider, harness, and authentication** covers the supported
combinations; models appear before credentials. **Enter another model ID**
allows manual entry but does not prove access. Execution mode follows the
harness; saved tokens require Codex. **Experimental Dedicated OpenClaw** shows
the runtime-build warning; Embedded OpenClaw does not.

In **Enter another model ID**, switch to **Choose a model from the list** and
back. Listed models and other settings should survive; focus moves to the active
input. Enter another listed model ID, return, and check its selection. A custom
ID requires a new selection. Change the provider through Configuration JSON;
the list must match without retaining the old provider's model.

The fixture supplies a ready Namespace, Preset, and model Secret. Namespace
provisioning, Preset CRUD, and service-account issuance have no dedicated console
pages. New version model Secrets and Slack tokens (Credentials tab and Channels
drawer) are selected or created through one Secret picker.
See [Create and deploy in the console](../reference/console/create-and-deploy.md)
for the supported installation workflow, prerequisites, and Teams deployment limits.

Repository previews cover access levels, empty or pending discovery, unavailable
choices, denied or unverified authorization, and reselection after a rejected save.
In **Repository choices unavailable**, follow the setup link or retry; creation
without repository access remains available. The recovery story keeps its saved
Configuration and requires a current nonempty repository selection before retrying.
The fixture does not verify operator prerequisites: GitHub App setup, Namespace
approvals, runtime images, and credential-service networking.

### Sharing

Use **Share before first deployment**, **Share while stopped**, **Configured and
deployed role permissions**, **Change OpenClaw role** and **OpenClaw roles
unavailable**. Inspect permissions, share a Principal, change its role and remove
the assignment. Self-assignment is explained above.

### Return to loaded pages

In **Return to loaded pages**, Tab to Namespaces and press Enter: focus reaches
its heading, then Refresh. Check editor retention through Back/Forward, Refresh,
refocus, and Namespace switches.

**Return Backend access denied** checks Installation-wide denial. **Return access denied** and **Return session expired** must remove retained private
content when the response arrives. These fixtures prove presentation only; the
[browser suite](../testing/local.md#console-browser-checks) proves authorization.
Reset story clears retained state.

### Keep edits while navigating

In **Pages/Agent detail → Keep Configuration edits**, **Components/Workspace →
Keep unsaved files**, **Components/Credentials → Keep authentication choices**,
and **Components/Channels → Keep Slack edits**, edit the form, visit another tab
or Namespaces, and return with Back/Forward. Check empty and invalid text, then
explicit Cancel or Reload. The Configuration story keeps deployment disabled;
workspace Save changes only the selected simulated file.

In **Flows → Restart Agent creation**, enter a default starter form, leave, and
confirm re-entry shows the initial choices and an empty form.

Use **Pages/Create Agent → Keep Preset variables** before applying a Preset and
**Keep an unsaved Preset draft** afterward. Ordinary fields survive; token
inputs clear. Revisit the Agents list to check its search filter. Denied,
loading, missing-file, and uncertain-write stories verify that retention does not
bypass the editor's access or recovery controls.

### Choose and switch revision Secrets

In **Components / Credentials / Slack tokens stored**, inspect references, cancel
creation, then switch app tokens; the bot binding stays unchanged. The API-key
switch offers another model Secret.

**Secret list denied** retains IDs. **Slack grant denied** requires recovery.
In **Issued service accounts unavailable**, switch authentication methods:
account feedback hides and returns with the saved issued-account selection.

In **Components/Channels → Slack Secret menu**, search names/IDs and select with
arrows and Enter. **Slack create Secret modal** shows Name and masked value.
In **Slack duplicate Secret name**, rename and retry without reentering the value;
browser tests cover controller rejection.

### Inspect bound Secrets in revisions

In **Components/Channels → Revision read only**, inspect Slack Secret identities;
switch to **Configuration** for Harness authentication. Values never appear.

**Revision Secret metadata denied**, **Revision Secret metadata missing**, and
**Revision Secret metadata loading** retain IDs during failed or pending reads.
**Revision without Slack bindings** shows **No Secret bound**.

### Discover and configure plugins

Plugin fixtures simulate catalogs, Secret metadata and policy capabilities;
installation, invocation access, runtime enforcement and Agent turns remain unverified.

In **Create Agent / Discover plugins with a service account token**, expand
**Access and credential setup** and inspect its links. Collapse it; at 390×844
and 390×640, check scrolling and reachable pagination. **Add Calendar**, edit a
tool, then **Done**: **Plugin selections JSON** shows the draft. **Search plugins**
queries the catalog; **Filter tools** filters locally. Credential changes clear
the catalog and keep selections.

**Preload plugins after entering a service account token** starts with the picker
closed; open it to reuse the background request. **Plugin search loading** holds
the response: loading starts while typing, keeps focus, and replaces empty-result
feedback. **Plugin tools loading** holds Calendar's details: check its loading
status and disabled **Add Calendar**. Reset to replay pending states before
timeout.

In **Discover plugins with a selected PAT Secret**, choose Calendar, then change
the Secret to clear discovery. **Selected PAT Secret discovery denied** previews
permission failure. Preset PAT Secrets enable discovery; API keys do not.

**Components/Plugins → Unavailable reason popover** covers keyboard access,
dismissal, compact rows, help links, detail guidance, and disabled **Add**.

In **Components/Plugins**, expand a tool to inspect inherited enablement and
approval. Unsupported per-tool review opens the plugin default. New plugins omit
tool defaults; omitted reviewers inherit the Harness reviewer. **Unsupported
saved tool reviewer** can be cleared to inherit. Tool IDs match JSON keys.

**Create Agent / Edit existing plugin policies** exercises the policy form.

**Pages/Agent detail → Edit plugins in new version** starts with Calendar saved.
**Plugins** preloads the catalog using its Service Accounts Secret. In **Configure
plugins**, add Documents, change Calendar's policy, save, and deploy. **Plugins in
admitted revision** shows the frozen snapshot.

### Update

**New version in progress** shows v7 deployment work while v6 stays current;
**Current version during deployment** opens v6 details while activity follows
v7. Compare queued, failed, activated, and unavailable activity stories.
In **First version**, resize the preview: each preparation step keeps its own
row and continuation lines align under the text.

Use **New version failed** and **Failed deployment logs from draft** to check
focused v7 Logs, output or denial, and Back. In **Runtime status and logs for v7**,
exercise source, instance, debug, fields, Follow, and filters. At 390px, check
readable rows and visible selected tabs through direct routes and Back/Forward.
These fixtures prove presentation, not live reads.

Version metadata stays visible when saved settings are unreadable. Follow the
[walkthrough](../../scripts/console-storybook/unreadable-configuration-workflow.md)
in **Unreadable Agent draft** and **Unreadable revision snapshot** to check
banner scope and navigation.

**Current observations** starts unrequested; compare
**Current observations for v7**, **Unknown observation for v6**, and
**Current observation unavailable**. Clicking requests timestamped diagnostics
for that version without changing its recorded deployment result.

Outcome-unknown stories in **Components/Channels** and **Components/Credentials**
disable deployment until **Reload draft**; they cannot prove a write committed.

Browsing does not deploy. Credentials need deployment; workspace writes apply
immediately. Native JSON excludes Agent-owned Backend and execution mode.
[Revisions and channel drafts](../reference/console.md#inspect-detail-revisions-and-channel-drafts)
defines version deployment and Slack sender access.

**Enable gateway password access** stages a reference. Cancel discards it; Save
Configuration, then Deploy new version applies it. Compare **Gateway password access configured**, **Gateway
password save denied**, and **Gateway password save in progress**. These stories
do not prove credential delivery or login.

### Stop

Open **Stop Agent**, inspect or cancel, then confirm. **Refresh stop status**
rereads the fixture's requested stopped state without proving live shutdown.

Resume by deploying a new version; disabling Slack does not stop an Agent. See
[Stop and resume](../reference/agents/deployment.md#stop-and-resume).

### Delete

Open **Delete Agent**, inspect or cancel, then confirm permanent deletion.
Cleanup state removes editing/deployment controls.
**Refresh deletion status** completes the fixture and returns to the Agent list.
Detailed cleanup progress is unavailable. Namespace-owned Configurations
and Secrets remain; manage them separately. See
[Agent deletion](../reference/agents.md#deletion).

Serving health, routing cutover, shutdown, channel delivery and model responses
require runtime verification. The console shows persisted deployment status.

## Maintain coverage

`scripts/console-storybook/` installs from its own manifest and lockfile under the
repository's seven-day release-age policy, independently of root dependencies.

- `prepare-assets.mjs` copies the current console assets and the shared contract
  modules served by the controller into ignored `dist/assets/`. Rebuild after
  source edits; the development server does not recopy console sources.
- `public/scenarios.mjs` owns story descriptions, initial data options, failure
  responses, automatic setup actions, and workflow instructions.
- `public/fixtures.mjs` intercepts API calls inside the preview. Unconfigured
  requests report an error and return 501; they never fall through to a server.
  Preview CSP also blocks network connections. Authentication and authorization
  responses are examples, not a security implementation.
- `public/frame.mjs` starts the production console and opens configured controls.
- `*.stories.mjs` exports named stories by group; `story.mjs` adds instructions,
  UI-gap notices, the preview, and Reset story.

Update scenarios and instructions with console changes, exporting new scenarios
from their owning story file. Configure API responses; the console owns failure
messages and UI markup.

## Debug image walkthrough

Open **Pages / Navigation / Debug runtime images**, expand an Agent, and inspect
the gateway image reference, digest, Enterprise source commit, and separate upstream
OpenClaw commit. The sidecar has unknown provenance for both commits.
Navigate to Namespaces, confirm `debug=true` persists, and repeat in the mobile
drawer. **Debug metadata unavailable** covers a failed read; ordinary navigation
stories hide diagnostics. Docker image inspection and the Kubernetes API/worker
integration suite, not these fixtures, verify Driver behavior.

### Slack reply and DM policy checks

In **Components/Channels → Slack Threaded Default**, save a new
channel-only setup with DMs disabled and inspect its native Configuration.
**Slack Reply Override** must preserve an existing `replyToMode: "off"`.
In **Slack Dm Policy**, exercise an empty Allowlist error, save explicit DM
sender IDs, then switch through Open, Disabled, and Pairing. Reopen the editor
after saving and verify channel senders stay unchanged. **Slack Enterprise Dm**
shows organization-wide policy restrictions. Missing-credential, read-only, and
save-failure stories cover the surrounding states.
Capture the final interactions and native values outside the repository;
attach reviewable screenshots and video to the task and PR.
