# Authorization

Identity and access management (IAM) determines who can read, create, change,
or operate OpenClaw Enterprise resources. Every operation is checked against
its exact action, resource, and [Namespace](namespaces.md). Requests without an
explicit matching grant are denied. This page defines the current authorization
contract; [authentication](authentication.md) defines how API clients establish
a session or verify a service key.

```

An authenticated principal is not automatically authorized. A user
session or service API key establishes the caller identity; the selected IAM Driver separately
checks whether that principal can perform the requested operation.

## Supported policy surface

Fresh native-IAM bootstrap provisions the human administrator and one
Installation-scoped, non-Agent ServicePrincipal. Each receives its own binding
to the same administrator Role, with no Namespace or resource filter:

| Resource kind                                | Actions                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `installation`                               | `administer`, `read`                                                    |
| `namespace`                                  | `create`, `read`, `delete`                                              |
| `configuration`, `preset`, `service_account` | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`                                    |
| `secret`                                     | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `operate`                         |
| `credential_source`                          | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `operate`                         |
| `agent`                                      | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `deploy`, `operate`, `administer` |
| `agent_revision`                             | `read`                                                                  |

These grants cover existing and future Namespaces in this Installation, subject
to exact authorization and matching Restrictions. They confer no Kubernetes or
provider authority. Rerunning bootstrap does not rewrite stored grants, so an
Installation bootstrapped before an action was added to this seed lacks it until
an administrator grants it; `credential_source:update` is one such action.
Custom Roles never gain permissions automatically. The
Preset upgrade extends only the unchanged built-in administrator Role; see
[Preset upgrade eligibility](presets.md#crud-and-permissions). Removing the original human account does not
remove the service identity. See
[bootstrap authentication](authentication.md#installation-and-account-ownership)
for credential delivery and lifecycle.

Administrators can provision additional local authentication accounts with a
binding to an existing Role, as defined in
[account provisioning](authentication.md#account-provisioning). Public signup
is disabled. Creating an account does not create a Role or implicitly grant
administrator rights.

Administrators manage immutable Namespace Roles and exact-resource identity
AccessBindings through the [Namespace policy APIs](#manage-namespace-policy).
Group, membership, Restriction, and broad grant management remain unavailable
through HTTP. The policy records below illustrate internal semantics; use the
API request shapes for public mutations.

## Principals

A principal names the actor requesting access. The platform has exactly two
principal types:

- **Principal:** An explicitly provisioned human identity identified by its
  trusted issuer and immutable subject.
- **ServicePrincipal:** An automation identity scoped to the Installation or
  one Namespace. Each [Agent](agents.md) owns exactly one immutable,
  Namespace-scoped ServicePrincipal; ordinary service principals can represent
  non-Agent automation.

The controller authenticates a user session for the human Principal or a
[service API key](authentication/service-api-keys.md#service-api-keys) for an explicitly provisioned,
non-Agent ServicePrincipal. Service-key lookup supplies the verified
`servicePrincipalId` and its stored Namespace to the selected IAM Driver; it does
not reinterpret a human issuer/subject as an automation identity.
An Agent created or deployed by that Principal retains its own separate service
principal. Agent-owned service principals have the same role-granted platform
capabilities as human Principals, subject to their Namespace scope, exact
resource grants, and matching Restrictions. When explicitly selected, the
[Kubernetes Compute Driver](drivers/kubernetes-compute.md) provisions an Agent-specific
ServiceAccount and can project a short-lived, audience-scoped ServiceAccount
token into that Agent's revision Pods. This projected token is credential
evidence for the Agent's existing ServicePrincipal, not another platform
principal. OCC token verification, identity exchange, and ServicePrincipal
workload authentication through the controller API remain deferred. Ordinary
service keys are deliberately unavailable to Agent-owned principals.

An unknown identity is denied. Email addresses, display names, caller-supplied
identity headers, or membership in another Namespace do not grant access.

## Permissions and Roles

A Permission allows one action on one resource kind. Supported permission
actions are `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `deploy`, `operate`,
`administer`, `read_logs`, and `use`; not every action has a corresponding public
endpoint yet. `read_logs` on an Agent delegates reading its runtime log text
without `administer`; fresh bootstrap does not grant it. Any of
these actions can be granted to either a human Principal or an Agent-owned
ServicePrincipal through an appropriately scoped Role and AccessBinding.

Agent runtime entry requires `agent:use` plus one exact direct person/Agent
runtime assignment. Installation administration and management grants do not
imply native permissions. See
[Agent OpenClaw access](agent-native-admin.md#native-authority-and-drift).

Resource kinds currently include `installation`, `namespace`, `configuration`,
`preset`, `agent`, `agent_revision`, `secret`, `credential_source`, and
`service_account`. Use the
[permissions cheat sheet](cheatsheets/permissions.md) for the resource matrix and
operations that require additional grants.

An OCC-owned [service account](service-accounts.md) is not an IAM principal.
Creation requires `create` in its exact Namespace; account operations require
their exact-account permission. Associated Agent operations require account
`read`; updating/detaching requires current-account `read`, and replacement
requires `read` on both old and new accounts. IAM never accesses credentials.

The [generated API reference](api.md) documents session and service-key authentication
and the exact permissions required by every operation. Its source is the
[generated OpenAPI contract](../../packages/contracts/openapi/occ-api.openapi.json),
where each human-readable operation description is accompanied by an
`x-openclaw-permissions` array containing each required `action`, `resourceKind`,
and scope. Collection scopes distinguish access to the requested parent from
the separate permission checked for each returned resource.

A Role groups Permissions:

```json
{
  "id": "role-support-agents",
  "namespaceId": "ns_45b6dbdb-2fc2-4c2c-9cc4-a94cf26cc6c2",
  "permissions": [
    { "action": "read", "resourceKind": "agent" },
    { "action": "create", "resourceKind": "agent" }
  ]
}
```

This example illustrates an internal policy record. Role creation takes only
`name` and `permissions`; OCC supplies its ID and Namespace.

## Access bindings and Groups

An AccessBinding attaches a Role to one principal or Group at a specific scope.
For example, this internal record grants the preceding Role to a Principal in
the `support` Namespace:

```json
{
  "id": "binding-support-alex",
  "namespaceId": "ns_45b6dbdb-2fc2-4c2c-9cc4-a94cf26cc6c2",
  "subjectKind": "identity",
  "subjectId": "principal-alex",
  "roleId": "role-support-agents"
}
```

Groups collect human Principals so one binding can grant the same Role to
multiple members; ServicePrincipals receive direct AccessBindings rather than
Group membership. Membership is direct and must remain inside the Group's scope;
a Namespace-scoped Group cannot grant access in another Namespace.

Bindings can apply to the singleton Installation, one Namespace, or one exact
resource. A binding without `namespaceId` is Installation-wide; a
Namespace-scoped binding applies only to its exact Namespace. An exact-resource
binding additionally identifies the resource kind and ID.

## Manage Namespace policy

Use `/namespaces/:namespaceId/iam/roles` and
`/namespaces/:namespaceId/iam/access-bindings`. Collection `GET` lists policy in
that Namespace and `POST` creates a server-identified resource. Item `GET`
reads one resource; item `DELETE` removes only that resource. Reads return
`200`, creation `201`, deletion `204`, and missing resources `404`.
The [Namespace IAM policy flow](../flows/namespace-iam-policy.md) traces the
controller, Driver, persistence, and audit path.
Installation bootstrap policy is excluded from these lists. Reads include existing
broad and Group bindings in the Namespace; deletion can revoke one by its exact
ID. The narrower subject and target requirements below apply to creation.

Every operation requires Installation `administer` and exact Namespace `read`,
evaluated by the selected IAM Driver and applicable Restrictions. Creating a
binding also requires `read` on its exact target.

A binding applies only its Role's Permissions for the target's resource kind,
and `create` is checked against the Namespace rather than an existing resource.
Binding creation therefore returns `400 INVALID_REQUEST` (detail path
`/roleId`) naming the Permissions when the Role has any `create` Permission or
none for the target's kind. One Role may still name several kinds and be bound
to a target of each. Ordinary resource access
does not authorize delegation. Drivers without policy management return
`503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`; OCC never substitutes native IAM.

Create a reusable Role with a nonempty, duplicate-free permission set. Each
Permission must be an action that some operation checks on that kind (the
per-kind table in the [permissions cheat sheet](cheatsheets/permissions.md));
a pair such as `secret:read_logs` or `configuration:deploy` would grant
nothing, so Role creation returns `400 INVALID_REQUEST` naming it:

```json
{
  "name": "Use a model Secret",
  "permissions": [{ "action": "operate", "resourceKind": "secret" }]
}
```

Bind it to the immutable `servicePrincipalId` returned in the Agent response:

```json
{
  "subjectKind": "identity",
  "subjectId": "<agent-service-principal-id>",
  "roleId": "<role-id>",
  "resourceKind": "secret",
  "resourceId": "<secret-id>"
}
```

The subject must be an existing human Principal or a ServicePrincipal in the
path Namespace. A human does not need a separate Namespace ServicePrincipal.
The Role and target must exist in the path Namespace. Exact targets and Role
permission kinds are `namespace`, `agent`, `agent_revision`, `configuration`,
`credential_source`, `preset`, `secret`, or `service_account`. `namespace`
permissions support only `read`, and for a `namespace` target, `resourceId` must
equal the Namespace ID in the path. A binding applies only the Role permissions
whose kind equals its target kind: an `agent_revision` permission bound to an
Agent target grants nothing, so revision `read` is bound per AgentRevision. A ServiceAccount
resource is not an IAM identity. Caller IDs, scope, wildcard targets, Groups, unknown permissions,
and extra fields are rejected. An invalid Permission, or a subject, Role or
target that is not usable in the path Namespace (including an Agent being
deleted), returns `400 INVALID_REQUEST` with the offending field as the detail
path. Native IAM commits validated policy and its
attributable audit event together; later requests on other replicas see it
without a restart.

For human discovery, grant `read` on that exact Namespace and separately grant
the required actions on each exact Agent. A Namespace target grants only
Namespace actions; it does not grant access to its Agents or permission to
create child resources. Human enrollment and grant creation are separate steps.

Roles and bindings cannot be updated. Create replacements and explicitly
remove old bindings. A referenced Role cannot be deleted (`409`), and deleting
one binding preserves equivalent and unrelated bindings. Deleting an Agent,
Configuration, Preset, Secret, credential source, or ServiceAccount removes the
bindings that target it in the same transaction, and its delete audit event lists
them (`removedAccessBindings`; for an Agent, `accessBindingsRemovedOnCompletion`).
Namespace teardown removes the Namespace's bindings and Roles with the tombstone
and records them in the lifecycle event. After an unknown
creation outcome, list and inspect policy before retrying; equivalent bindings
may coexist. Names are labels: inspect permissions before reusing a Role.

Deleting a binding does not establish effective denial: other bindings and
Restrictions still apply. Revocation blocks later admission but cannot retract
already delivered bytes. Stop the Agent and revoke upstream credentials when
immediate containment is necessary; IAM changes do neither automatically.

## Restrictions

A Restriction narrows permissions that would otherwise be granted. It can deny
an exact action for a resource kind, a Namespace, or an exact resource:

```json
{
  "id": "restriction-support-deploy",
  "namespaceId": "ns_45b6dbdb-2fc2-4c2c-9cc4-a94cf26cc6c2",
  "action": "deploy",
  "resourceKind": "agent",
  "effect": "deny"
}
```

A matching Restriction overrides direct identity grants and Group grants. A
Restriction never grants access, expands scope, or selects a different
authorization provider.

## Authorization decisions

For each protected operation, the controller:

1. Verifies the user session or service key and resolves its existing
   Principal or non-Agent ServicePrincipal through the selected IAM Driver.
2. Uses the server-configured IAM Driver for the requested resource.
3. Loads current policy, including principal bindings and direct Group memberships.
4. Requires a Role Permission matching the exact action and resource kind.
5. Verifies the exact Installation, Namespace, or resource scope.
6. Rejects matching Restrictions equally for human and service principals.
7. Records attributable authorization evidence without exposing credentials.

Lists are also authorized per resource. Permission to deploy an Agent does not
automatically grant permission to read it, and permission to read one Agent
does not expose every Agent in the Namespace. First deployment additionally
checks Agent `read` and `operate` if Compute must generate missing transport
credentials.

[Agent runtime reads](../guides/topics/agent-logs.md#who-can-see-what) use two
tiers on the exact Agent and revision: Pod status and Events need Agent
`operate` and `read` plus revision `read`; container log text needs Agent
`read_logs` or `administer` and Agent `read`, which cover every revision of that
Agent, including later deployments. A matching
`read_logs` Restriction denies log text even to a holder of `administer`. Each
follow poll is authorized again, so revoking a grant stops the next poll.

The selected IAM Driver loads current authoritative policy for each identity
lookup and authorization decision. Account and permission changes become
visible across controller instances without restarting or replacing the Driver.

An unavailable IAM Driver, invalid policy, missing grant, mismatched scope, or
ambiguous identity fails closed.

## Denials and failures

- `401`: The session cookie or service key is missing, invalid, expired, or revoked.
- `403`: The principal lacks an exact grant, belongs to another Namespace, or
  matches a deny Restriction.
- `404`: The requested resource does not exist under its exact parent.
- `503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`: The selected IAM or audit dependency is
  unavailable; no fallback authorization provider is used.
- A resource is absent from a list: Your identity may not have `read`
  permission for that specific resource.
- `400` creating a Role or binding: the detail path names the invalid field.
- `409` deleting a Role: the Role is referenced by AccessBindings; remove them
  explicitly first.
- Group or broad-grant mutation is rejected: Namespace policy APIs support
  identity subjects and exact resource targets only.
