# Agents

An Agent is a named AI workload in a [Namespace](namespaces.md), with its own
identity, revision history, and deployed gateway. Its permissions do not grant
access to another Namespace's resources.

Use a [Preset](presets.md) to copy reusable launch settings into a new Agent draft.

To get one running, [deploy your first Agent](../guides/first-agent.md). For an
existing Agent, see [Compute](../guides/topics/agent-compute.md) for execution
choices, [Agent Revisions](../guides/topics/agent-revisions.md) for changes, or
[Troubleshoot](../guides/topics/agent-troubleshoot.md) if a deployment stalls.

Creating an Agent saves its identity and exact Namespace-owned Configuration
reference with `active` status and `stopped` desired runtime state. No revision is
created and no workload or model starts until an authorized caller requests
[deployment](#identity-and-deployment).

## Supported operations

Operations beneath `/namespaces/:namespaceId/agents` return `201` for creation,
`200` for reads/updates, and `202` for deployment, stop, or deletion. Deployment
returns the admitted AgentRevision. Stop sets
`desiredRuntimeState` to `stopped`. Lists require each Agent's exact `read`.
See [API schemas, envelopes, and permissions](api.md).

Responses include immutable `servicePrincipalId` for
[Namespace IAM bindings](authorization.md#manage-namespace-policy). Do not derive
it from the Agent ID; create/update reject caller-supplied values.

Creation body:

```json
{
  "name": "ticket-triage",
  "configurationId": "cfg_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
  "executionMode": "dedicated",
  "backendId": null
}
```

Creation requires a `provisioning` or `ready` Namespace, a same-Namespace
Configuration with `kind: "agent"`, Namespace Agent `create`, and exact
Configuration `read`. See [Harness authentication](#harness-authentication)
for credential permissions and [authorization](authorization.md) for grants.

### Unreadable saved settings

For unreadable saved settings, Agent and revision list/detail GETs omit them
without defaults, keep readable metadata and siblings, and add
`configurationReadError` with `code: "SAVED_CONFIGURATION_UNREADABLE"` and the
affected `field`. Authorization and strict mutation/runtime validation are unchanged;
query failures still fail requests. See the
[Console warning](../guides/console/agent-details.md#unreadable-saved-settings).

## Deployment status

The `deploymentId` is the admitted AgentRevision ID returned by
`POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deploy`. Its `202` means the
revision was admitted and queued, not that the workload is ready. Poll it with:

```text
GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deployments/:deploymentId
```

This requires exact AgentRevision `read`, not Agent `operate`.
Responses include `deploymentId`, `namespaceId`, `agentId`, `status`, nullable
`error`, plugin `warnings`, and nullable `progress`.

- `queued`: no live claim, including after lease expiry.
- `running`: a live worker claim.
- `succeeded`: original work activated the revision or found it already active.
- `failed`: terminal failure or completion without activation.

Pending `progress.lastAttempt` contains the latest exact-work result's
allowlisted `code`, fixed `message`, and `at`, when first recorded; repeated
deferrals record once ([readiness codes](agents/deployment.md#pending-deployment-progress)). Null means no bound evidence, not proof work never ran. Maintenance and
cleanup results are excluded. `progress.nextAttemptAt` is the earliest queued
eligibility, not a promised start; it is null while claimed. Terminal `progress`
is null. Results describe recorded checks, not runtime health.

Errors have fixed codes, messages, and allowlisted `error.data`.
`CONVERGENCE_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` data includes positive `timeoutMs` and optional
`runtimeFailure` (`component`, `check`, `checkedAt`, `code`) captured by Compute
from that revision; missing evidence leaves the cause unspecified. Held runtime
failures end deployment early: `RUNTIME_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` (rejected
credential), `RUNTIME_CPU_STARVED`, `RUNTIME_MODEL_PROBE_TIMEOUT`,
`RUNTIME_MODEL_PROBE_FAILED`, `RUNTIME_LOGIN_FAILED`, or
`RUNTIME_STARTUP_FAILED`; fix and redeploy. A dedicated gateway that refuses its
own CLI fails with
[`AGENT_GATEWAY_UNAUTHORIZED`](agents/deployment.md#pending-deployment-progress). `RUNTIME_MODEL_PROBE_FAILED` adds
[`runtimeFailure`](agents/deployment.md#model-check-failure-cause). Success can include [plugin warnings](agent-plugins.md#lifecycle)
with a closed code and admitted `pluginId`.

Polling reads persisted state without runtime, provider, or model probes.
Terminal results survive runtime deletion and controller restart. Later
deployments have separate records and cannot rewrite earlier results.

### Current runtime diagnostics

A bodyless `POST` to
`/namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deployments/:deploymentId/diagnostics`
requests fresh checks for the exact revision. It requires Agent read and operate
plus AgentRevision read. The response has a revision ID, observation time, and
at most 32 bounded checks. Kubernetes currently probes Slack configuration,
authentication, and connectivity without sending. Missing Pods yield `unknown`;
unavailable evidence yields `503`. The call changes no stored deployment state
and proves no model response. See the [diagnostics flow](../flows/agent-deployment-diagnostics.md).

## Backend association

An Agent can reference one Installation-configured [experimental Backend](backends.md)
through `backendId`, a nullable reference returned on Agent and AgentRevision
responses. Create/PATCH omission, `null`, and ID validation follow the
[association rules](backends.md#agent-association-and-immutable-deployment);
no default is inferred.

The reference is independent of native model names and Harness selection.
OpenAI or Anthropic API keys and directly supplied service account tokens need
no Backend. An OCE-issued ChatGPT account token requires the matching Backend and
account at deployment request and again before startup.
Creating an Agent does not create a provider account or issue credentials.

## Harness authentication

`harnessAuth` selects how an Agent obtains model credentials. Creation
omission stores `null`; PATCH omission preserves the binding and explicit `null`
clears it. Both supported topologies require a valid binding at deployment.
A managed source must belong to the Agent's exact Namespace:

```json
{
  "harnessAuth": {
    "method": "api_key",
    "source": {
      "kind": "secret",
      "namespaceId": "ns_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
      "id": "sec_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000"
    }
  }
}
```

For a service account token, use `"method": "codex_pat"` with its Secret `source`.
This requires dedicated Codex.

Personal [Codex OAuth device login](../guides/deploy/credential-lifecycle.md#use-a-personal-codex-login)
is **Experimental**. Bind the returned `source` with `"method": "oauth"`.

For an already issued ChatGPT account credential, use
`{ "method": "codex_pat", "source": { "kind": "service_account", "namespaceId": "ns_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000", "id": "sa_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000" } }`.
This requires dedicated Codex and the account's matching `backendId`. Binding
an account does not issue its credential or change the model, Harness, or Backend.

**Development upgrade limitation:** migration `0049` rejects retained
`chatgpt_service_account` bindings in Agent drafts, any historical AgentRevision,
or provisioning plans, and rolls back without converting them. No API deletes a
revision or provisioning request on its own: delete each affected Agent, which
also deletes its revisions and requests, and create it again after the upgrade.
Changing the binding does not clear historical revisions. For a request that
never created an Agent, see
[clear legacy bindings](settings/operations.md#clear-legacy-managed-pat-bindings-before-0049).

For dedicated Codex with a Credential Gateway, use
`{ "method": "credential_source", "sourceId": "cs_…" }`; see
[credential sources](credential-sources.md#bind-a-source-to-an-agent) for grants.
It must also be listed in `credentialSources`.

For SSH embedded OpenClaw, use `{ "method": "runtime" }`. The operator supplies
credentials in the protected host environment file; OCC neither reads nor
delivers them and performs no authentication or model probe, so readiness does
not prove model access. The snapshot records only the method, so host credential
changes can affect existing revisions. Agent and Configuration authorization,
topology checks, and process readiness remain required; no credential-source
permission is needed. Kubernetes and Docker reject this method. See
[SSH credentials](drivers/ssh-compute.md#credentials-and-supported-boundaries).

API-key, OAuth, and service account token bindings require the actor's exact Secret `operate`. That includes
the Secret the Agent already uses: every draft update checks it, including one that replaces it. Deployment also
requires the Agent service principal's exact Secret `operate`. ChatGPT binding
requires the actor's exact account `read`, including the current account on every draft update. There is no implied account grant for the Agent
principal. Each consumer of a shared source is authorized independently.

Deployment freezes binding references; dispatch rechecks source ownership and
actor/Agent grants. Draft changes take effect only on deployment. Public
responses omit credential values and private backend/account metadata. See
[supported providers, topologies, and credential delivery](harness-execution.md#harness-authentication) and
[Secret consumption grants](drivers/kubernetes-secret.md#bind-a-secret-to-gateway-environment).

## Plugin selections

An Agent can own an optional `plugins` map keyed by qualified curated catalog ID,
such as `google-calendar@openai-curated-remote`. Omission at creation enables no
plugins. PATCH omission preserves the saved plugin map, `{}` clears every desired
plugin, and a nonempty map replaces the entire desired plugin set.

Create/update validates only structural shape. Catalog membership, native
identity resolution, and approval-policy support are checked when deployment
starts the revision; unsupported selections fail that startup without partially
mutating the Agent. AgentRevision snapshots retain the requested plugin IDs and
policy. See [Agent plugins](agent-plugins.md) for field semantics
and the selected-only runtime contract.

## Workspace files

### Initial contents at creation

`POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents` accepts `initialWorkspaceFiles`, an optional
partial map of the four filenames below to strings. Replace the example Configuration ID:

```json
{
  "name": "Support assistant",
  "configurationId": "cfg_12345678-1234-4123-8123-123456789abc",
  "initialWorkspaceFiles": { "AGENTS.md": "Answer support questions.\n", "USER.md": "" }
}
```

Omission or `{}` uses native initialization; omitted filenames keep native
behavior. Empty strings create empty files. Values must satisfy the live-file
Unicode and 16 KiB limits below; other names and non-strings are rejected.
The API preserves whitespace and newlines. Create requests default to 448 KiB,
including JSON escaping; configured controller limits take precedence.

Creation uses existing permissions and stages inputs privately
outside Agent, Configuration, and AgentRevision. First deployment applies them
before execution. Completion prevents replay over later edits. Staged bytes are
removed after activation or Agent deletion. Pending inputs have no read/update
API; correction requires deleting and recreating the Agent.

The optional `workspaceDefaultsId` is a SHA-256 defaults identity. Console sends
all four rendered `2026.9.8` defaults with this identity. A stale identity rejects
creation with `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`; runtime mismatch blocks initial setup.
See the [workspace guide](../guides/topics/workspace-files.md) and
[setup flow](../flows/workspace-files.md) for recovery and runtime requirements.

### Live file access

Read, create, or replace `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `USER.md`
in an Agent's live workspace:

```text
/namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/workspace/files/:name
```

| Method | Operation                  | Agent permission | Response `data`     |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `GET`  | Read the file              | `read`           | `{ name, content }` |
| `PUT`  | Create or replace the file | `operate`        | `{ name, size }`    |

Authenticate with a session or scoped service API key. Session-authenticated
writes must pass the [CSRF checks](authentication.md). The Agent must have an
active revision and a reachable gateway.

`PUT` accepts one `content` field:

```json
{ "content": "You are a support assistant.\n" }
```

`content` must be well-formed Unicode without NUL characters and fit within
16 KiB when encoded as UTF-8. The complete request body is limited to 48 KiB.
Success returns `200`. A successful `PUT` reports `size` in UTF-8 bytes and
records the Agent, file name, and outcome in the audit log.

| Error                        | Meaning                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `400 INVALID_REQUEST`        | Invalid file name or content.                        |
| `404 NOT_FOUND`              | The requested Agent or file was not found.           |
| `409 AGENT_DELETING`         | The Agent is being deleted.                          |
| `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`      | The Agent is stopping.                               |
| `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`      | The request body exceeds 48 KiB.                     |

| `503 UNKNOWN_OUTCOME`        | OCC could not confirm the write or its audit record. |

After `UNKNOWN_OUTCOME`, read the current file before deciding whether to submit
another write.

See [gateway routing](gateway-routing.md) for transport,
[workspace-file setup](../guides/deploy/workspace-routing.md#agent-workspace-files) to enable
access, the [HTTP API](api.md#get-namespacesnamespaceidagentsagentidworkspacefilesname)
for schemas, and the [execution flow](../flows/workspace-files.md) for implementation.

## Native admin UI

Trusted operators can open the selected Agent gateway's stock native admin UI
when the Installation enables [Agent native admin UI access](agent-native-admin.md).
The availability route requires exact Agent `use` and runtime assignment; `read` and `operate`
are insufficient. The Agent must be desired running, have an active revision,
and expose a private gateway endpoint through the selected Compute Driver.

A derived per-Agent browser host proxies to the private gateway route using the
OCE session cookie under the shared cookie parent domain; OCC still authorizes
the exact Agent ([session boundary](agent-native-admin.md#shared-session-boundary)).
Native edits do not become Configuration changes or AgentRevision snapshots,
and redeploy does not erase all gateway-local state
([drift](agent-native-admin.md#native-authority-and-drift)).

## Namespace ownership

An Agent belongs to the Namespace in its creation URL; request bodies cannot
select a different Namespace or Installation. Names are unique within each
Namespace, and cross-Namespace access requires separate scoped permissions.
A failed or deleting Namespace rejects new Agents.

## Identity and deployment

Each Agent has one stable service principal and runs embedded OpenClaw or
dedicated Codex. A deployment request takes no body: it snapshots the saved
draft, and a worker starts it asynchronously. See
[Agent identity and deployment](agents/deployment.md) for permissions,
snapshot fields, and activation guarantees.

An authorized bodyless `POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/stop`
sets desired state to `stopped`. The worker removes execution and routing, then
clears `activeRevisionId`; revision history, credentials, and persistent state
remain. Cleanup includes failed candidate resources and interrupted predecessor
retirement owned by the current Compute. Repeating stop is safe. To resume,
deploy a new revision; old revisions cannot be restarted. See
[stop and resume](agents/deployment.md#stop-and-resume).

## Deletion

A bodyless `DELETE /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId` requires exact-Agent
`delete`, sets `status: deleting` and desired state `stopped`, queues teardown,
and returns `202`. Reads remain available; updates, deployment, credential
provisioning, and workspace writes return `409`. Repeated DELETE leaves queued
or running work unchanged.

The worker reauthorizes the original caller, binds the persisted identity into
Compute, retires all revisions, and removes runtime credentials. It then
atomically deletes the Agent, revisions, service principal, its API keys, and
exact IAM bindings and restrictions. Kubernetes retirement waits for owned Pods
and removes owned artifacts, including workspace data. Namespace Configurations
and Secrets survive. Deletion releases its name;
[repository cleanup](repository-credentials.md#repo-driver-contract) continues independently.

Teardown retries are bounded; after permanent failure or exhaustion, the Agent
stays `deleting`. After a fix, the initiating caller can repeat DELETE to
replenish the attempt budget; OCC and the worker recheck permission. Another
permitted actor gets `403`, audited with the `initiatingActorId`, until the
initiator loses permission, then takes over. Prior failure audits remain and
each retry is audited, as in [Namespace recovery](namespaces.md#failure-semantics-and-limitations).

## Editable configuration

An Agent's `configurationId` selects exactly one native OpenClaw Configuration
document with `kind: "agent"` in its own Namespace. A PATCH requires
`configurationId`, exact-Agent `update`, and exact-Configuration `read`.
This replaces the reference, preserving execution mode, harness binding, and Backend:

```json
{
  "configurationId": "cfg_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

Edit the Configuration's native document through its own exact-resource PATCH
endpoint ([Configuration CRUD](configuration.md#create-read-update-and-delete)). Changing
the Agent reference or Configuration values does not queue Compute work,
change the active revision, or mutate earlier revisions. Create and update
accept no inline configuration document or competing gateway settings. Agents can share a Configuration; each
deployed Agent still owns its gateway and stable service principal.

## Current limitations

The public API has no revision mutation/deletion or explicit rollback endpoint.
Controller API authentication for Agent service principals remains unavailable.
The optional
[OpenShell SandboxDriver](drivers/openshell-sandbox.md) requires bundled
Kubernetes Compute and dedicated Codex; other sandbox execution combinations are
rejected. Stock OpenShell cannot provide all required workload credentials; check
its compatibility limits before planning deployment.

## Failure semantics

- `400 INVALID_REQUEST`: The Backend ID is malformed or empty, the plugin map is
  structurally invalid, or a runtime `modelApiKey` selector is supplied (use
  `harnessAuth`).
- `404 NOT_FOUND`: The nonempty Backend ID does not name a configured Backend.
- `401`: The session cookie is missing, invalid, expired, or revoked.
- `403`: Your principal lacks the exact permission for the Agent or Namespace.
- `404`: The Namespace or Agent does not exist under the requested parent, or
  the selected Configuration or associated service account is not in the Agent's
  Namespace.
- `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`: Harness authentication is missing, the selected
  account has no issued access token, or its Backend binding or topology is incompatible.
- `409 SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DRIVER_NOT_CONFIGURED`: The account has no access token,
  and the Installation has no ChatGPT Backend to issue one.
- `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`: Another Agent already uses that name in the same
  Namespace, the Namespace cannot accept new Agents, or a stopping Agent cannot
  accept the requested mutation.
- `409 AGENT_DELETING`: The Agent is [deleting](#deletion) and rejects the
  mutation.
- `409 NAMESPACE_NOT_READY`: The backing Namespace infrastructure is not ready
  for deployment.
- `503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`: A selected Harness descriptor, Compute
  implementation, or other required dependency is unavailable.
- `503 RUNTIME_CREDENTIALS_CLUSTER_RBAC`: The cluster denied the API
  ServiceAccount access to the Agent's runtime credential Secrets or Deployment
  preflight. An operator must [grant the tenant RoleBindings](../guides/deploy/production-agents.md#grant-tenant-rolebindings).
