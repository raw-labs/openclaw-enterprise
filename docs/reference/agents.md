# Agents

An Agent is a named AI workload in a [Namespace](namespaces.md), with its own
identity, revision history, and deployed gateway. Its permissions do not grant
access to another Namespace's resources.

Use a [Preset](presets.md) to copy reusable launch settings into a new Agent draft.

To get one running, [deploy your first Agent](../guides/first-agent.md). For an
existing Agent, see [Compute](../guides/topics/agent-compute.md) for execution
choices, [Agent Revisions](../guides/topics/agent-revisions.md) for changes, or
[Troubleshoot](../guides/topics/agent-troubleshoot.md) if a deployment stalls.

Creating an Agent saves its identity and exact Namespace-owned Configuration
reference with an `active` lifecycle status and a `stopped` desired runtime
state. No workload or model starts, and no revision is created, until an
authorized caller requests deployment. See [identity and deployment](#identity-and-deployment)
for revision, execution, and stop behavior.

## Supported operations

Operations beneath `/namespaces/:namespaceId/agents` return `201` for creation,
`200` for reads/updates, and `202` for deployment, stop, or deletion. Deployment
returns the admitted AgentRevision; Compute work remains asynchronous. Stop sets
`desiredRuntimeState` to `stopped`. Lists require each Agent's exact `read`.
See [API schemas, envelopes, and permissions](api.md).

Responses include immutable `servicePrincipalId` for
[Namespace IAM bindings](authorization.md#manage-namespace-policy). Do not derive
it from the Agent ID; create/update reject caller-supplied values.

Creation body:

```json
{
  "name": "ticket-triage",
  "configurationId": "cfg_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
  "executionMode": "dedicated",
  "backendId": null
}
```

Creation requires a `provisioning` or `ready` Namespace, a same-Namespace
Configuration with `kind: "agent"`, Namespace Agent `create`, and exact
Configuration `read`. See [Harness authentication](#harness-authentication)
for model credential permissions, [authentication](authentication.md) for caller
identity, and [authorization](authorization.md) for grants.

### Unreadable saved settings

Agent and revision list/detail GETs preserve readable metadata with unreadable settings,
adding `configurationReadError` with `code: "SAVED_CONFIGURATION_UNREADABLE"`
and the affected `field`. Settings are omitted without defaults; readable
siblings remain available. Authorization and strict mutation/runtime validation
are unchanged. Query failures still fail requests. See the
[Console warning](../guides/console/agent-details.md#unreadable-saved-settings).

## Deployment status

The `deploymentId` for status polling is the admitted AgentRevision ID returned
by `POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deploy`. The deploy response
being `202` means OCC admitted immutable revision state and queued work; it does
not mean the workload is ready.

Poll the original deployment work with:

```text
GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deployments/:deploymentId
```

Exact AgentRevision read permission is required; Agent `operate` is unnecessary.
Responses include `deploymentId`, `namespaceId`, `agentId`, `status`, nullable
`error`, plugin `warnings`, and nullable `progress`.

- `queued`: no live claim, including after lease expiry.
- `running`: a live worker claim.
- `succeeded`: original work activated the revision or found it already active.
- `failed`: terminal failure or completion without activation.

Pending `progress.lastAttempt` contains the latest exact-work result's
allowlisted `code`, fixed `message`, and `at`, when first recorded; repeated
deferrals record once ([readiness codes](agents/deployment.md#pending-deployment-progress)). Null means no bound evidence, not proof work never ran. Maintenance and
cleanup results are excluded. `progress.nextAttemptAt` is the earliest queued
eligibility, not a promised start; it is null while claimed. Terminal `progress`
is null. Results describe recorded checks, not runtime health.

Errors have fixed codes, messages, and allowlisted `error.data`.
`CONVERGENCE_DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` data includes positive `timeoutMs` and optional
`runtimeFailure` (`component`, `check`, `checkedAt`, `code`) captured by Compute
from that revision; missing evidence leaves the cause unspecified. Held runtime
failures end deployment early: `RUNTIME_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` (rejected
credential), `RUNTIME_CPU_STARVED`, `RUNTIME_MODEL_PROBE_TIMEOUT`,
`RUNTIME_MODEL_PROBE_FAILED`, `RUNTIME_LOGIN_FAILED`, or
`RUNTIME_STARTUP_FAILED`; fix and redeploy. Success can include [plugin warnings](agent-plugins.md#lifecycle)
with a closed code and admitted `pluginId`.

Polling reads persisted state without runtime, provider, or model probes.
Terminal results survive runtime deletion and controller restart. Later
deployments have separate records and cannot rewrite earlier results.

### Current runtime diagnostics

A bodyless `POST` to
`/namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/deployments/:deploymentId/diagnostics`
requests fresh checks for the exact revision. It requires Agent read and operate
plus AgentRevision read. The response has a revision ID, observation time, and
at most 32 bounded checks. Kubernetes currently probes Slack configuration,
authentication, and connectivity without sending. Missing Pods yield `unknown`;
unavailable evidence yields `503`. The call changes no stored deployment state
and proves no model response. See the [diagnostics flow](../flows/agent-deployment-diagnostics.md).

## Backend association

An Agent can reference one Installation-configured [experimental Backend](backends.md)
through `backendId`. Create omission means `null`; PATCH omission preserves the
saved value, while explicit `null` clears the draft reference. A nonnull ID must
resolve to a configured Backend. No default is inferred. The nullable reference
is returned on both Agent and AgentRevision responses.

The Backend reference is independent of native model names and Harness
selection. An Agent using an OpenAI or Anthropic API key, or a directly supplied
service account token, does not need a Backend. An OCE-issued ChatGPT account
token requires the matching Backend and account when deployment
is requested and again before startup; see [Backend deployment checks](backends.md#agent-association-and-immutable-deployment).
Creating an Agent does not create a provider account or issue credentials.

## Harness authentication

`harnessAuth` selects how an Agent obtains model credentials. Creation
omission stores `null`; PATCH omission preserves the binding and explicit `null`
clears it. Both supported topologies require a valid binding at deployment.
A managed source must belong to the Agent's exact Namespace:

```json
{
  "harnessAuth": {
    "method": "api_key",
    "source": {
      "kind": "secret",
      "namespaceId": "ns_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
      "id": "sec_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000"
    }
  }
}
```

See [supported providers and topologies](harness-execution.md#harness-authentication).

For a service account token, use `"method": "codex_pat"` with its Secret `source`.
This requires dedicated Codex.

Personal [Codex OAuth device login](../guides/deploy/credential-lifecycle.md#use-a-personal-codex-login)
is **Experimental**. Bind the returned `source` with `"method": "oauth"`.

For an already issued ChatGPT account credential, use
`{ "method": "chatgpt_service_account", "serviceAccountId": "sa_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000" }`.
This requires dedicated Codex and the account's matching `backendId`. Binding
an account does not issue its credential or change the model, Harness, or Backend.

For dedicated Codex with a Credential Gateway, use
`{ "method": "credential_source", "sourceId": "cs_…" }`; see
[credential sources](credential-sources.md#bind-a-source-to-an-agent) for grants.

For SSH embedded OpenClaw, use `{ "method": "runtime" }`. The operator supplies
credentials in the protected host environment file; OCC neither reads nor
delivers credentials and performs no authentication/model probe. Agent and
Configuration authorization, topology checks, and process readiness remain
required. No credential-source permission is needed because OCC owns no source.
Kubernetes and Docker reject this method. See [SSH credentials](drivers/ssh-compute.md#credentials-and-supported-boundaries).

API-key, OAuth, and service account token bindings require the actor's exact Secret `operate`. Deployment also
requires the Agent service principal's exact Secret `operate`. ChatGPT binding
requires the actor's exact account `read`, including the current account when
replacing or clearing a binding. There is no implied account grant for the Agent
principal. Each consumer of a shared source is authorized independently.

Deployment freezes binding references; dispatch rechecks source ownership and actor/Agent grants.
Public responses omit credential values and private backend/account metadata. Draft
changes require deployment. A `runtime` snapshot records only its method: host
credential changes can affect existing revisions, and readiness does not prove model access. See
[credential delivery](harness-execution.md#harness-authentication) and
[Secret consumption grants](drivers/kubernetes-secret.md#bind-a-secret-to-gateway-environment).

## Plugin selections

An Agent can own an optional `plugins` map keyed by qualified curated catalog ID,
such as `google-calendar@openai-curated-remote`. Omission at creation enables no
plugins. PATCH omission preserves the saved plugin map, `{}` clears every desired
plugin, and a nonempty map replaces the entire desired plugin set.

Agent create/update validates only structural shape. Catalog membership, native
identity resolution, and approval-policy support are checked when a deployment
starts the revision; unsupported selections fail that startup rather than
partially mutating the Agent. AgentRevision snapshots retain the requested
plugin IDs and policy. See [Agent plugins](agent-plugins.md) for field semantics
and the selected-only runtime contract.

## Workspace files

### Initial contents at creation

`POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents` accepts `initialWorkspaceFiles`, an optional
partial map of the four filenames below to strings. Replace the example Configuration ID with yours:

```json
{
  "name": "Support assistant",
  "configurationId": "cfg_12345678-1234-4123-8123-123456789abc",
  "initialWorkspaceFiles": { "AGENTS.md": "Answer support questions.\n", "USER.md": "" }
}
```

Omission or `{}` uses native initialization; omitted filenames keep native
behavior. Empty strings create empty files. Values must satisfy the live-file
Unicode and 16 KiB limits below; other names and non-strings are rejected.
The API preserves whitespace and newlines. Create requests default to 448 KiB,
including JSON escaping; configured controller limits take precedence.

Creation uses existing permissions, stays undeployed, and stages inputs privately
outside Agent, Configuration, and AgentRevision. First deployment applies them
before execution. Completion prevents replay over later edits. Staged bytes are
removed after activation or Agent deletion. Pending inputs have no read/update
API; correction requires deleting and recreating the Agent.

The optional `workspaceDefaultsId` is a SHA-256 defaults identity. Console sends
all four rendered `2026.9.6` defaults with this identity. A stale identity rejects
creation with `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`; runtime mismatch blocks initial setup.
See the [workspace guide](../guides/topics/workspace-files.md) and
[setup flow](../flows/workspace-files.md) for recovery and runtime requirements.

### Live file access

Read, create, or replace `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `USER.md`
in an Agent's live workspace:

```text
/namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/workspace/files/:name
```

| Method | Operation                  | Agent permission | Response `data`     |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| `GET`  | Read the file              | `read`           | `{ name, content }` |
| `PUT`  | Create or replace the file | `operate`        | `{ name, size }`    |

Authenticate with a session or scoped service API key. Session-authenticated
writes must pass the [CSRF checks](authentication.md). The Agent must have an
active revision and a reachable gateway.

`PUT` accepts one `content` field:

```json
{ "content": "You are a support assistant.\n" }
```

`content` must be well-formed Unicode without NUL characters and fit within
16 KiB when encoded as UTF-8. The complete request body is limited to 48 KiB.
Successful requests return `200`; `size` is the written content's UTF-8 byte
count. Successful writes record the Agent, file name, and outcome in the audit log.

| Error                        | Meaning                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `400 INVALID_REQUEST`        | Invalid file name or content.                        |
| `404 NOT_FOUND`              | The requested Agent or file was not found.           |
| `409 AGENT_DELETING`         | The Agent is being deleted.                          |
| `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`      | The Agent is stopping.                               |
| `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`      | The request body exceeds 48 KiB.                     |
| `503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` | Workspace access is unavailable.                     |
| `503 UNKNOWN_OUTCOME`        | OCC could not confirm the write or its audit record. |

After `UNKNOWN_OUTCOME`, read the current file before deciding whether to submit
another write.

See [gateway routing](gateway-routing.md) for transport configuration and
[workspace-file setup](../guides/deploy/workspace-routing.md#agent-workspace-files) to enable
access, the [HTTP API](api.md#get-namespacesnamespaceidagentsagentidworkspacefilesname)
for request and response schemas, and the [execution flow](../flows/workspace-files.md)
for implementation details.

## Native admin UI

Trusted operators can open the selected Agent gateway's stock native admin UI
when the Installation enables [Agent native admin UI access](agent-native-admin.md).
The availability route requires exact Agent `use` and runtime assignment; `read` and `operate`
are insufficient. The Agent must be desired running, have an active revision,
and expose a private gateway endpoint through the selected Compute Driver.

The native UI uses the Agent's derived browser host and the existing private
gateway route. The derived host authenticates with the ordinary OCE browser
session cookie under the configured shared cookie parent domain; OCC still
resolves and authorizes the exact Agent before proxying. OCE does not turn
native edits into Configuration changes or AgentRevision snapshots. Redeploy
applies the managed revision again but does not erase all gateway-local state.

## Namespace ownership

An Agent belongs to the Namespace in its creation URL. The controller assigns
that ownership; request bodies cannot select a different Namespace or
Installation.

Names are unique within each Namespace. Cross-Namespace access requires
separate scoped permissions.

You can create an Agent while its Namespace is still `provisioning`. A failed
or deleting Namespace rejects new Agents.

## Identity and deployment

Each Agent has one stable service principal and runs embedded OpenClaw or
dedicated Codex. A deployment request takes no body: it snapshots the saved
draft, and a worker starts it asynchronously. See
[Agent identity and deployment](agents/deployment.md) for the permissions,
snapshot fields, and activation guarantees.

An authorized bodyless `POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/stop`
sets desired state to `stopped`. The worker removes execution and routing before
clearing `activeRevisionId`; revision history, credentials, and persistent state
remain. Cleanup includes failed candidate resources and interrupted predecessor
retirement owned by the current Compute. Repeating stop is safe. A later
deployment creates a new revision and sets desired state back to `running`;
you cannot restart an old revision directly.

## Deletion

A bodyless `DELETE /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId` requires exact-Agent
`delete`, sets `status: deleting` and desired state `stopped`, queues teardown,
and returns `202`. Reads remain available; updates, deployment, credential
provisioning, and workspace writes return `409`. Repeated DELETE leaves queued
or running work unchanged.

The worker reauthorizes the original caller, binds the persisted identity into
Compute, retires all revisions, and removes runtime credentials. It then
atomically deletes the Agent, revisions, service principal, its API keys, and
exact IAM bindings and restrictions. Kubernetes retirement waits for owned Pods
and removes owned artifacts, including workspace data. Namespace Configurations
and Secrets survive. Deletion releases its name;
[repository cleanup](repository-credentials.md#repo-driver-contract) continues independently.

Teardown retries are bounded. After permanent failure or exhaustion, the Agent
stays `deleting`. After a fix, the initiating caller can repeat
DELETE to replenish the attempt budget. OCC and the worker recheck permission.
Another permitted actor takes over only once the initiator lost permission.
Until then it gets `403`, audited with the `initiatingActorId`.
Prior failure audits remain; each retry is audited. Namespace deletion
has the same [recovery](namespaces.md#failure-semantics-and-limitations), including takeover.

## Editable configuration

An Agent's `configurationId` selects exactly one native OpenClaw Configuration
document with `kind: "agent"` in its own Namespace. A PATCH requires
`configurationId`, exact-Agent `update`, and exact-Configuration `read`.
This replaces the reference, preserving execution mode, harness binding, and Backend:

```json
{
  "configurationId": "cfg_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000"
}
```

The request returns `200` with the updated Agent. Update the Configuration's
native nested document through its own exact-resource PATCH endpoint; see
[Configuration CRUD](configuration.md#create-read-update-and-delete). Changing
the Agent reference or Configuration values does not queue Compute work,
change the active revision, or mutate earlier revisions. Agent create and update
accept a Configuration reference, optional execution mode, optional harness authentication
binding and Backend association, and optional Agent-owned plugin selections;
they do not accept an inline configuration document or competing gateway
settings. Multiple Agents can
share the same Configuration;
each deployed Agent still owns its own gateway and stable service principal.

## Current limitations

The public API has no revision mutation/deletion or explicit rollback endpoint.
Controller API authentication for Agent service principals remains unavailable.
The optional
[OpenShell SandboxDriver](drivers/openshell-sandbox.md) requires bundled
Kubernetes Compute and dedicated Codex. Stock OpenShell cannot provide all the
required workload credentials; review the documented compatibility limits before
planning a deployment. Other sandbox execution combinations are rejected.

## Failure semantics

- `400 INVALID_REQUEST`: The Backend ID is malformed or empty.
- `400 INVALID_REQUEST`: The plugin map is structurally invalid.
- `404 NOT_FOUND`: The nonempty Backend ID does not name a configured Backend.
- `401`: The session cookie is missing, invalid, expired, or revoked.
- `403`: Your principal lacks the exact permission for the Agent or Namespace.
- `404`: The Namespace or Agent does not exist under the requested parent.
- `404`: The selected Configuration does not belong to the Agent's Namespace.
- `404`: An associated service account does not belong to the Agent's Namespace.
- `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`: Harness authentication is missing, the selected
  account has no issued access token, or its Backend binding or topology is incompatible.
- `400 INVALID_REQUEST`: A runtime `modelApiKey` selector is supplied. Use
  `harnessAuth` explicitly.
- `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT`: Another Agent already uses that name in the same
  Namespace, the Namespace cannot accept new Agents, or a stopping Agent cannot
  accept the requested mutation.
- `409 AGENT_DELETING`: The Agent is deleting and cannot accept update,
  deployment, credential-provisioning, or workspace-write mutations.
- `409 NAMESPACE_NOT_READY`: The backing Namespace infrastructure is not ready
  for deployment.
- `503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`: A selected Harness descriptor, Compute
  implementation, or other required dependency is unavailable.
