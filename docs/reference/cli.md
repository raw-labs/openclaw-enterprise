# OCC CLI command reference

`occ` manages OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC) resources. To install it and make
your first request, see [CLI setup](../guides/cli.md). To see help for the
installed version, run `occ --help` or add `--help` to a command.

## Global options

Command-line flags override the corresponding environment variables.

| Flag                 | Environment variable   | What it controls                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--url`              | `OCC_URL`              | Required for resource commands. An HTTP or HTTPS origin, without embedded credentials, a base path, query, or fragment.          |
| `--service-key-file` | `OCC_SERVICE_KEY_FILE` | Required for resource commands. Path to the complete bootstrap or issued service-key JSON response.                              |
| `--namespace`        | `OCC_NAMESPACE`        | Required for `configuration`, `secret`, `credential-source`, `iam`, and `agent` commands. Supply the Namespace ID, not its name. |
| `--ca-bundle`        | `OCC_CA_BUNDLE`        | Adds a PEM certificate-authority bundle to the system trust roots for HTTPS. TLS verification cannot be disabled.                |
| `--timeout-seconds`  | `OCC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`  | Positive whole seconds for an HTTP request. Default: `30`.                                                                       |
| `--output`, `-o`     | —                      | Output format: `table` (default), `json`, or `yaml`.                                                                             |
| `--help`, `-h`       | —                      | Prints help for the command.                                                                                                     |
| `--version`, `-v`    | —                      | Prints the CLI version. Source builds report `dev`; published binaries report their OCE release version.                         |

The service-key JSON must contain a nonempty `data.key` with no line breaks.
The client sends it as `x-api-key` and does not follow redirects. Use a trusted
HTTPS endpoint unless connecting to a local loopback development Installation.
See [Service API Keys](authentication/service-api-keys.md) for issuing or rotating
keys.

Pressing Ctrl-C, or sending `SIGTERM`, cancels an in-flight request and exits
with an error instead of waiting for `--timeout-seconds` to expire.

## Resource commands

Replace `ID` with the corresponding resource ID, `NAME` with a Namespace name,
and `FILE` with a JSON file path. `--file` reads a local file, not stdin; YAML
input is not supported. The server validates document fields against the
[HTTP API contract](api.md). `--help` on `configuration`, `secret`, `agent`,
`iam role`, and `iam access-binding` `create` shows a minimal sample document.

Use the [HTTP API](api.md) to work with ServiceAccounts and configured
Backends; the CLI has no commands for these. Neither the CLI nor the HTTP API
offers Configuration listing. An accepted deploy returns a revision; `agent get`
shows desired state, `LIFECYCLE` (`active` or `deleting`), and the selected
revision, not runtime health. Run `occ agent deployment-status ID` for the
latest deployment's status and error, and verify the model separately.

Commands take IDs, not names. The CLI rejects a value without the expected
prefix, such as `ns_` or `agt_`, and names the list command that shows the ID.

The `installation get`, `installation deployment-inventory`, and `namespace
list` commands require an Installation-scoped service key. With a
Namespace-scoped key, use `namespace get ID` to read that exact Namespace
instead.

`installation deployment-inventory` requires Installation `administer`, exact
`read` access to every Namespace and Agent, exact `read` access to each selected
Agent's active revision, and exact `deploy` access to every running Agent that is
eligible for coordinated deployment. It fails instead of silently omitting an
unauthorized resource. JSON and YAML output include each Agent's desired runtime
state, execution mode, active revision, and whether deployment work is queued or
claimed.

## Runtime status and logs

`occ agent runtime AGENT_ID` and `occ agent logs AGENT_ID` read the
[Agent logs](../guides/topics/agent-logs.md) routes. Without `--revision ID`,
both read the latest revision when it is newer than the active one and has Pods
(a deploy in progress or a failed replacement, whose Pods hold the failure),
else the active revision, else the latest revision. They print the revision they
read to stderr; a reader without Agent `operate` cannot check for Pods, so the
notice names the newer revision to pass. `runtime` accepts `-o table|json|yaml`
and needs Agent `operate` and `read` plus `read` on the revision. Its table output
ends with each Pod's Events (`POD`, `CONTAINER`, `TYPE`, `REASON`, `COUNT`,
`LAST SEEN`, `MESSAGE`); `CONTAINER` is `-` for Pod-level Events. `logs` needs
Agent `administer` and `read` plus `read` on the revision, and each view is
audited.

| `occ agent logs` flag  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--source SOURCE`      | Required: `gateway`, `agent` (dedicated Harness container) or `sandbox` (OpenShell policy decisions; no `--pod` or `--previous`).                                                                          |
| `--revision ID`        | Revision to read; defaults as described above.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `--pod NAME`           | Pod to read when the source has more than one.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `--previous`           | Read the container instance before the last restart.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `--tail N`             | Lines from the end of the stream, 1 to 1000 (default 200).                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--since DURATION`     | Only lines newer than a Go duration such as `10m`, up to `24h`.                                                                                                                                            |
| `--follow`             | Poll every 2 seconds with the view's cursor until Ctrl-C.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `--level LEVEL`        | Only `error`, `warn`, `info` or `debug` lines and above, filtered by OCC after `--tail` (the last N lines are read, then filtered, so fewer may print); lines of unknown level stay. Default: every level. |
| `-o text` or `-o json` | Text lines (default) or NDJSON, one API record per line.                                                                                                                                                   |

Text output prints `TIME LEVEL KIND [SUBSYSTEM] MESSAGE key=value` per line.
Gap and withheld records are printed to stderr as `notice:` lines; in JSON mode
they are also records on stdout. With `--follow`, the CLI waits for
`Retry-After` after a `429`, retries after a `504`, starts a new audited view
when the cursor is rejected, and exits cleanly on Ctrl-C. `501`, `503` and
permission errors end the command with a nonzero exit. `--follow` cannot be
combined with `--previous`.

```sh
occ agent runtime agt_...
occ agent logs agt_... --source gateway --since 10m
occ agent logs agt_... --source gateway --follow -o json | jq -r .message
```

## Output and errors

Table output is meant for people; it prints `-` for unset fields and `No
resources found.` for an empty list. JSON and YAML print the resource or array
without the HTTP envelope. Deleting a Configuration prints
`Deleted configuration ID.` in table mode; structured output contains
`deleted`, `kind`, and `id`.

Failures go to stderr and the CLI exits nonzero. For HTTP errors, the CLI prints
the status and, when present, the API error code and message. It does not print
the server's request ID. To capture that ID for a failed request, use the
[HTTP API directly](../guides/http-api.md#troubleshoot).

## Local development

Run these from a repository checkout. They use local development configuration,
not the remote connection or output options above. Kubernetes is the supported
local setup for deploying an Agent; follow [Local Setup](../guides/quickstart.md).

| Command                        | What it does                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `occ dev up`                   | Starts the profile selected by `OCC_DEVELOPMENT_COMPUTE_DRIVER`: `docker` (default) or `kubernetes`. Docker is a control-plane preview and cannot deploy Agents.               |
| `occ dev up --key-output PATH` | Writes the bootstrap service-key file to an absent absolute path in a private directory.                                                                                       |
| `occ dev down`                 | Stops the selected profile. Docker keeps Compose volumes by default. Kubernetes removes its owned k3d cluster; the Compose control-plane profile also removes Compose volumes. |
| `occ dev down --volumes`       | Also removes Docker Compose volumes; Kubernetes cleanup already removes its volumes.                                                                                           |

Compose global options, when needed, must follow `--`. Keep the cleanup command
printed by startup so it selects the same profile and state directory.
The explicitly selected Kubernetes-only profile rejects Compose options. Use
`scripts/dev-up` and `scripts/dev-down` as the common entry points for every
profile; the Compute and Sandbox Driver settings select the implementation.
