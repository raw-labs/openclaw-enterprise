# Production controller settings

This reference owns production controller settings. Start with the
[settings reference](../settings.md) for startup configuration and precedence.

## Required production controller environment

The production API is internal-only by default. Operators must provision an
internal Kubernetes `ClusterIP` Service and a default-deny ingress
`NetworkPolicy` that allows only explicitly approved namespace and Pod
selectors. The cluster must enforce NetworkPolicies. Do not expose the listener
through a `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`, `hostNetwork`, or public endpoint.

The Helm charts allow DNS egress on UDP/TCP ports `53` and `5353` to their
configured `dns.namespace` and `dns.podLabels` peers. Port `5353` supports
OpenShift DNS backends after Service address translation. These grants cover
API, worker, initialization, collector, Slack proxy, Envoy, and observability
demo workloads.

The trusted-operator native admin pilot is the only documented public-ingress
exception: the console host and Agent wildcard hosts route to OCC through the
procedure in [Deploy native admin UI access](../../guides/deploy/native-admin.md).
Envoy and Agent gateway Services remain private, and OCC strips the shared OCE
session cookie before forwarding to the native gateway.

| Variable                                   | Required value or format                                                                                           | Behavior                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`                                 | Exactly `production`.                                                                                              | Enables durable production controller composition.                                                                      |
| `OCC_HOST`                                 | One explicit Pod interface IP address.                                                                             | Wildcard addresses and implicit hostnames are rejected.                                                                 |
| `OCC_PORT`                                 | Decimal integer from `1` through `65535`.                                                                          | Selects the internal listener port exposed by the operator's Service.                                                   |
| `OCC_DATABASE_URL`                         | Explicit PostgreSQL application-role URL.                                                                          | Must connect to the already migrated controller database.                                                               |
| `OCC_CONFIG_PATH`                          | Absolute path to trusted Installation startup YAML.                                                                | Selects Configuration, IAM, Compute, and optional account Drivers.                                                      |
| `OCC_AUTH_SECRET`                          | Mounted high-entropy Better Auth secret.                                                                           | Signs and verifies session material without logging it.                                                                 |
| `OCC_AUTH_BASE_URL`                        | Absolute HTTP(S) origin without a path, query, fragment or user info.                                              | Defines the production Better Auth base URL and cookie origin.                                                          |
| `OCC_GATEWAY_API_KEY_PATH`                 | Optional absolute path to the private gateway service-key file.                                                    | API only; validates at startup and reads each operation for rotation. Requires Compute endpoint resolution.             |
| `OCC_CHANNEL_DIRECTORY_PROXY_URL`          | Optional HTTP(S) proxy URL with one literal IPv4 address and explicit port, or the exact Helm-managed Service URL. | API only; routes Slack lookup and credential validation through an HTTP CONNECT tunnel. Invalid values fail startup.    |
| `OCC_CHANNEL_DIRECTORY_MANAGED_PROXY_HOST` | Optional exact Helm-managed proxy Service host.                                                                    | API only; the one DNS host the Slack directory Driver accepts in the proxy URL instead of an IPv4 address.              |
| `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`                      | Optional PEM bundle for a private gateway CA.                                                                      | Node reads it at process startup. Normal leaf renewal under that CA does not require a restart; root-bundle changes do. |

For Helm, prefer `slackProxy.enabled` over an external
`api.channelDirectoryProxyUrl`; the
[Slack Channel Driver](../drivers/slack-channel.md#enable-lookup-in-production)
owns both options' API-only proxy egress and the proxy's `slack.com:443`
requirement. With neither, the chart renders no proxy egress rule, and Slack
lookup and credential validation require another approved network route.

`OCC_AGENT_RUNTIME_LOGS_ENABLED` (`true` or `false`, default `true`) switches the
[Agent logs](../../guides/topics/agent-logs.md) routes; `false` makes them answer
`501`. The chart sets it from `agentRuntimeLogs.enabled`.

When the native admin pilot is enabled, the API also requires:

| Variable                         | Required value or format                                                                                                                                     | Behavior                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OCC_AGENT_NATIVE_ADMIN_ENABLED` | `true`.                                                                                                                                                      | Enables the trusted-operator Agent native admin UI path.                                                    |
| `OCC_AGENT_NATIVE_ADMIN_DOMAIN`  | Agent host suffix, such as `agents.oce.example.com`, without scheme, wildcard, port, or path.                                                                | Derives stable per-Agent browser hosts.                                                                     |
| `OCC_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`         | Shared OCE session cookie parent, such as `oce.example.com`; not a public suffix and must contain the console host and Agent suffix on DNS-label boundaries. | Scopes the ordinary Better Auth session cookie to the console and Agent hosts when native admin is enabled. |

For changes to startup `logging.level`, follow the
[log-level procedure](../../guides/observability.md#1-choose-the-log-level).

The API and worker load the same trusted startup YAML; only the API initializes
the optional [Backend client](../backends.md). Both validate Backend membership
and stored ownership before accepting work. With the bundled Kubernetes Compute
Driver, `drivers.compute.configuration` holds the
[`KubernetesComputeDriverOptions` shape](../drivers/kubernetes-compute.md#configuration).
Production use of that Driver requires `images.requireImmutableDigest: true`,
digest-pinned gateway and Agent image references, and exactly one in-cluster
identity or explicitly named kubeconfig/context. The processes then verify
authenticated, TLS-checked, read-only Kubernetes Namespace access before serving
requests or claiming work. Installed Drivers validate their own reviewed
configuration and implementation-specific prerequisites.

Agent workspace-file requests use the selected Compute Driver's private gateway
endpoint. Kubernetes derives the URL from the optional `gatewayRouting.hostname`
and the admitted Namespace and Agent IDs. If the hostname is omitted or empty,
Compute derives the chart's Service DNS hostname from the required `gatewayName`,
`gatewayNamespace`, and `envoyNamespace`. It derives the allowed Envoy peer from
those settings and rejects explicit `network.gatewayClients` in routed mode. It
does not read a per-Agent endpoint file or persist a URL in Agent Configuration.
See [private Agent gateway routes](../drivers/kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md#private-agent-gateway-routes)
for the hostname contract and each setting's role.

`OCC_GATEWAY_API_KEY_PATH` mounts a dedicated, high-entropy Envoy service key;
never reuse the Better Auth signing secret or a model-provider credential.
Missing or invalid key files fail startup; a file that becomes unavailable
during rotation makes new requests unavailable. The worker needs
route configuration and namespace-bound HTTPRoute permissions, but no service
key or CA bundle for native file access.

With Helm routing enabled and no `gatewayRouting.issuerRef.name`, cert-manager
bootstraps a private CA and issues Envoy's certificate. The chart projects only
the generated root Secret's public `tls.crt` into the API and sets
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`; the CA signing key is never mounted into OCC. An explicit
issuer selects operator-managed issuance instead. Its optional `caSecretName`
and `caSecretKey` must be supplied together when additional CA trust is needed.

See the [deployment procedure](../../guides/deploy/workspace-routing.md#agent-workspace-files)
for Envoy, cert-manager, native trusted-proxy configuration, and key/certificate rotation.
Kubernetes gateway authentication is always trusted-proxy; private routing
still requires the Installation, Helm, and service-key settings above. Unsupported Drivers and unavailable endpoints return
`503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`.

Sessions and service keys grant no rights without IAM; see
[denials](../authorization.md#denials-and-failures) for `401` and `403`,
[Authentication](../authentication/service-api-keys.md#service-api-keys) for service-key issuance,
scope, and revocation, and the [deployment guide](../../guides/deploy/service-keys.md#service-api-keys-for-automation)
for the procedure. Normal issuance and verification require no additional
settings; initial-key delivery uses the bootstrap settings below.
Auth-secret rotation takes effect after
replacing the mounted Secret and restarting the process; it also invalidates every
[known-device cookie](../authentication.md#known-devices) until each browser's next sign-in.
Revoking one account's cookies needs no rotation: reset its password.

### GitHub sign-in and trusted proxies

These optional variables apply to the API only. The chart never passes them to
the worker or initialization Job.

| Variable                           | Helm value                                 | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OCC_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`        | `auth.github` Secret key `clientIdKey`     | GitHub App client ID. Set the client ID, client secret, and recovery user ID together or not at all.                                                                                                                     |
| `OCC_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`    | `auth.github` Secret key `clientSecretKey` | GitHub App client secret, read from the dedicated `auth.github.secretName` Secret.                                                                                                                                       |
| `OCC_AUTH_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORGS`     | `auth.github.allowedOrgs`, comma-joined    | Optional GitHub organization logins whose active members may sign in; see [allowlist](../authentication/external-sign-in.md#organization-and-team-allowlist). At most 10 entries with the teams. Requires the client ID. |
| `OCC_AUTH_GITHUB_ALLOWED_TEAMS`    | `auth.github.allowedTeams`, comma-joined   | Optional `org/team-slug` entries whose active members may sign in. The GitHub App needs organization permission Members: read.                                                                                           |
| `OCC_AUTH_GITHUB_RECOVERY_USER_ID` | `auth.recoveryUserId`                      | Existing local password administrator's user ID; designates the recovery account on first activation.                                                                                                                    |
| `OCC_AUTH_PASSWORD_SIGN_IN`        | `auth.passwordSignIn`                      | `all` (default, not rendered) or `recovery-only`: only the recovery account may use a password. Needs GitHub, Google or OIDC; see [recovery-only](../authentication/external-sign-in.md#recovery-only-password-sign-in). |
| `OCC_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`     | `api.trustedProxy.cidrs`                   | Comma-separated IPv4 or IPv6 CIDRs, subject to the limits below. Requests whose socket peer is inside them may carry forwarded headers.                                                                                  |
| `OCC_AUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_PRESET`    | `api.trustedProxy.preset`                  | `ingress-nginx` (default), `aws` or `generic`. Named presets read `x-forwarded-for`. Set with the CIDRs.                                                                                                                 |
| `OCC_AUTH_CLIENT_IP_HEADER`        | `api.trustedProxy.clientAddressHeader`     | Lowercase header name, up to 64 characters, `generic` only. Sign-in limits key on the client address it carries from a trusted peer.                                                                                     |

The chart's API Deployment always uses the `Recreate` strategy: an upgrade stops
the old API Pod before starting the new one, so two controllers never serve
together. Activation still requires closed ingress and stopped identity writers.

With `auth.github.enabled`, the chart adds an API-only egress policy on TCP 443
for `github.com` and `api.github.com`. Empty `auth.github.egressCidrs` allows
any address except link-local `169.254.0.0/16`. To narrow it, list the `web` and `api`
IPv4 ranges from `https://api.github.com/meta`, and update them when GitHub changes them.
A non-empty list replaces the default, so an egress proxy on a link-local address is
reached by listing its CIDR; the same holds for Google and OIDC. Listed CIDRs carry no
link-local exception, so keep them narrow.

`api.trustedProxy` defaults off: `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-*`, and `X-Real-IP`
return `403`. Failed password sign-ins have per-email limits only: browsers behind
a proxy share its address. With GitHub, Google or OIDC, start, callback, and result
key on browser cookies; start has only an active cap and the 1,000-pending-attempt
cap. Startup logs `authentication.sign-in-limit-warning`; Helm notes and profile
rendering also warn without failing. Set `api.trustedProxy` unless the API sees
each client's address. Presets:

- `ingress-nginx`: trust the ingress controller Pod CIDR; read `x-forwarded-for`.
  Keep `use-forwarded-headers` off.
- `aws`: trust Application Load Balancer subnets targeting API Pods; read
  `x-forwarded-for`. A source-preserving Network Load Balancer needs no preset
  unless it fronts ingress-nginx.
- `generic`: `cidrs` and `clientAddressHeader`, such as `x-real-ip`, are required.

Trust only proxies that overwrite or append the header, and admit them through
`api.clients`. Any IPv4-mapped IPv6 spelling counts as IPv4 (prefix 1–32).
The API and chart refuse entries covering every IPv4 or IPv6 address, including
`/0`. Mapped peers and header hops use dotted IPv4 sign-in limit keys.

Rendering fails on incomplete GitHub values, an allowlist entry that is
not an organization login or `org/team-slug`, more than 10 allowlist entries, a shared Secret,
`agentNativeAdmin.enabled` with GitHub, refused proxy CIDRs, another header with a
named preset, or credential, routing and internal headers such as `cookie`.

### Google sign-in

These optional variables also apply to the API only. Google sign-in uses the same
guarded profile and `OCC_AUTH_GITHUB_RECOVERY_USER_ID` recovery user as GitHub; see
[Google sign-in](../../guides/deploy/google-sign-in.md).

| Variable                          | Helm value                                 | Behavior                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OCC_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`       | `auth.google` Secret key `clientIdKey`     | Google OAuth web client ID; determines the provider instance. Set it with the client secret and recovery user ID, or not at all.                   |
| `OCC_AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`   | `auth.google` Secret key `clientSecretKey` | Google OAuth client secret, read from the dedicated `auth.google.secretName` Secret.                                                               |
| `OCC_AUTH_GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | `auth.google.allowedDomains`               | Optional comma-separated hosted domains. When set, the ID token's `hd` must match one and `email_verified` must be `true`. Requires the client ID. |

With `auth.google.enabled`, the chart adds the API-only egress policy
`openclaw-enterprise-api-google-login-egress` on TCP 443 for
`oauth2.googleapis.com` and `www.googleapis.com`. Empty `auth.google.egressCidrs`
allows any address except link-local `169.254.0.0/16`; narrow it with an egress proxy.
Rendering fails on incomplete Google values, a Secret shared with GitHub or any other
chart Secret, `agentNativeAdmin.enabled` with Google, an HTTP base URL, or an allowed
domain that is not a DNS name.

### OIDC sign-in

These optional variables also apply to the API only, with the same guarded profile and
recovery user; see [OIDC sign-in](../../guides/deploy/oidc-sign-in.md).

| Variable                                                     | Helm value                                          | Behavior                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OCC_AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER`                                       | `auth.oidc.issuer`                                  | The exact `iss`; with the client ID it determines the provider instance.                    |
| `OCC_AUTH_OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL`, `_TOKEN_URL`, `_JWKS_URL` | `auth.oidc.authorizationUrl`, `tokenUrl`, `jwksUrl` | `https:` on 443 on the issuer's DNS host, no userinfo, query or fragment. Never discovered. |
| `OCC_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OCC_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`     | `auth.oidc` Secret keys                             | Read from the dedicated `auth.oidc.secretName` Secret. All required values or none.         |
| `OCC_AUTH_OIDC_TOKEN_AUTH`                                   | `auth.oidc.tokenAuth`                               | `client_secret_post` (default, not rendered) or `client_secret_basic`.                      |
| `OCC_AUTH_OIDC_DISPLAY_NAME`                                 | `auth.oidc.displayName`                             | Optional Console label, 1–40 printable characters.                                          |

With `auth.oidc.enabled`, the chart adds the API-only egress policy
`openclaw-enterprise-api-oidc-login-egress` on TCP 443. Empty `auth.oidc.egressCidrs`
allows any address except link-local `169.254.0.0/16`. The port is the destination Pod's
port; an IdP inside the cluster on another target port needs
[its own egress policy](../../guides/deploy/oidc-sign-in.md#configure-the-chart). Rendering fails on values the API refuses,
a Secret shared with GitHub, Google or any other chart Secret, `agentNativeAdmin.enabled`
with OIDC, or an HTTP base URL.

### Production Installation bootstrap environment

Both environments run `node scripts/bootstrap-installation.mjs` after migration.
`NODE_ENV` selects `development` or `production`; no other mode is accepted.
The initializer uses the application-role database and Better Auth settings.
Development consumes the [`OPENCLAW_DEV_*` defaults](development.md#required-development-controller-environment) and only the private
service-key output path; it never writes a password file. API/worker startup
requires the resulting Installation and does not create credentials.

The packaged Helm initialization Job creates the singleton Installation,
human and service administrators, and initial [`default` Namespace](../namespaces.md#initial-namespace)
before starting the API or worker. Namespace provisioning completes asynchronously
through the worker. Its separate migration
init container receives only `OCC_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`; the bootstrap
container receives the application-role `OCC_DATABASE_URL`, Better Auth
settings, and the following bootstrap settings. The Job sets `backoffLimit: 0`;
failed initialization requires [manual repair](../../guides/deploy/service-keys.md#recover-an-incomplete-bootstrap)
before another attempt.

| Variable                          | Required value or format                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OCC_AUTH_SECRET`                 | Same mounted Better Auth secret used by the API.                                                        |
| `OCC_AUTH_BASE_URL`               | Same as the API; HTTPS unless the host is `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.                                   |
| `OCC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`       | Email address for the first administrator account.                                                      |
| `OCC_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_FILE`     | New file path on protected operator-owned storage for the generated password.                           |
| `OCC_BOOTSTRAP_INSTALLATION_NAME` | Installation display name; it must follow the API Name rule (`INSTALLATION_NAME_INVALID`).              |
| `OCC_BOOTSTRAP_SERVICE_KEY_FILE`  | New private absolute JSON path; on fresh production bootstrap, a distinct sibling of the password file. |

Repeated bootstrap preserves the existing Installation only when the exact
administrator account and IAM identity still match; a mismatch fails closed.
Existing Namespaces and their configuration remain unchanged; no initial
Namespace is backfilled or recreated.
On fresh bootstrap, both files are created exclusively with mode `0600`; their
parent directory must be private and neither destination may already exist.
Helm sets the key path from `bootstrap.password.mountPath` and
`bootstrap.serviceKey.fileName` (default `initial-admin-service-key.json`). The
key filename must be a simple basename distinct from `bootstrap.password.fileName`.
Both use the existing `bootstrap.password.claimName` PVC. Reruns do not inspect,
replace, or regenerate output; see [recovery](../../guides/deploy/service-keys.md#recover-an-incomplete-bootstrap).

## Production operational logging collection

`logging.collector` configures the bundled Helm Collector; `enabled` defaults to
`false`. For enablement, existing-Collector reuse, Secret creation, networking,
and delivery checks, use
[Configure platform observability](../../guides/observability.md#kubernetes-and-helm).

When enabled, the chart requires a digest-pinned image, an exact exporter
destination (IPv4 `/32` or paired namespace/Pod selectors), a TCP port, and
nonempty dedicated configuration and environment Secret names. Neither Secret
may reuse the Installation, database, auth, or ChatGPT Backend Secret, or, when
the feature is enabled, a GitHub, Google, or OIDC sign-in Secret, the gateway API
key, a repository-credentials Secret, or an execution-cluster kubeconfig. The named
Secrets must be in the control-plane namespace:

- `configSecretName` supplies `collector.yaml`, `kubernetes.yaml`, and
  `exporter.yaml` keys.
- `envSecretName` supplies exporter variables, including
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT`, through `envFrom`.

Relevant Helm values:

```yaml
logging:
  collector:
    enabled: true
    image: docker.io/otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.159.0@sha256:1f2c54a30e713fac6b3ae77a1ec84010c2007e29ced8ec666214fc2f6739c1cc
    configSecretName: occ-otel-collector-config
    envSecretName: occ-otel-collector-exporter
    exporter:
      cidr: 203.0.113.10/32
      port: 443
    state:
      sizeLimit: 128Mi
```

See [chart defaults](../../../deploy/helm/openclaw-enterprise/values.yaml) for
`resources`, `state.sizeLimit`, and `tmp.sizeLimit`. The
[security reference](../security.md#operational-log-collection-boundary) owns the
credential, runtime-export, and workload isolation boundaries.

The chart rejects obvious malformed quantities such as `foo`, `10MiB`, and
`1K` in top-level `resources`, Collector `resources`, and Collector volume size
limits, with an error naming the setting. Kubernetes remains responsible for
complete quantity validation; exponent ranges and numeric parsing edge cases
are not checked during rendering. A successful render does not prove API
acceptance. Setting a resource map or Collector size limit to `null` clears its
chart default; a null size limit leaves that volume unlimited.

### Private telemetry defaults

`metrics.enabled` defaults to `true`, with API and worker listeners on their Pod
IP at port `9464`. Both `metrics.scraperNamespaceLabels` and
`metrics.scraperPodLabels` default to empty: no metrics ingress is granted until
both are set. Partial selectors and invalid or API-colliding ports fail rendering.
See [scraping and discovery](../../guides/observability/metrics.md).

For an in-cluster log receiver, set both
`logging.collector.exporter.namespaceLabels` and `podLabels`, set its `port`,
and leave `cidr` empty. This alternative cannot be combined with a CIDR.
Collector metrics use the same paired selector contract under
`logging.collector.metrics`, on fixed port `8888`; metrics ingress is opt-in.
The chart grants only the selected peer and port. Other NetworkPolicies remain
additive, so review them when assessing effective access.
