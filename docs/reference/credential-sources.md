# Credential sources

A credential source registers a Namespace Secret with the Installation's
selected [Credential Gateway](drivers/credential-gateway.md). The gateway keeps
its own copy of the value and applies it outside the Agent workload, so the
Harness never receives the real credential. An Agent uses a source through
[`harnessAuth`](agents.md#harness-authentication).

Credential sources require a selected Credential Gateway. The only
implementation is the [OpenShell Credential Gateway](drivers/openshell-credential-gateway.md),
which supports one source type, `openai`, for dedicated Codex model
authentication. OpenShell is not a supported production Agent path; see its
[remaining blockers](drivers/openshell-sandbox.md#current-upstream-preconditions).

## Register a source

1. Wait for the Namespace to become `ready`.
2. [Create a Secret](drivers/kubernetes-secret.md#create-a-namespace-owned-secret)
   that holds the value, and keep its `ref`.
3. Send `POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources`. The caller needs
   `credential_source:create` on the Namespace and `secret:operate` on every
   referenced Secret:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "openai-production",
     "type": "openai",
     "secrets": {
       "api_key": {
         "kind": "secret",
         "namespaceId": "ns_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
         "id": "sec_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

A successful request returns `201` with the source metadata. Its `id` starts
with `cs_`, and `ref` is the reference used in Agent bindings. The response
includes the gateway's `status` but never a credential value.

The request fields are:

- `name`: required; unique within the Namespace.
- `type`: required; a type from the gateway catalog. Unknown types fail with
  `404` before any gateway call.
- `config`: optional nonsecret strings keyed by catalog field name.
- `secrets`: Secret references keyed by catalog field name. Each Secret must
  belong to the same Namespace.

OCC rejects unknown fields and missing required fields before it reads any
Secret. It reads each value through the Secret Driver, sends the values to the
gateway, and stores only the Secret references. OCC records the source as
`registering` before the gateway call. If the gateway rejects the registration,
OCC deletes any copy and the record. If the call fails without an answer, such as
on a timeout, a copy may still appear later, so the record stays listed as
`deleting`; send DELETE to remove it.

## Read and list sources

`GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId` requires
exact `read`. It returns the record plus live `status` from the gateway:
`ready`, `pending`, `failed`, or `absent`, with an optional `reason`. If the
gateway cannot answer, `status` is `failed` with a fixed reason; the read still
succeeds.

`GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources` requires Namespace `read`
and returns only sources on which the caller has exact `read`. Lists
do not call the gateway and omit `status`.

The record's `state` is `registering`, `ready`, or `deleting`. A source left
`registering` by an interrupted request never becomes usable; delete it to
remove any gateway copy. A `registering` or `deleting` source cannot be
bound or deployed.

## Bind a source to an Agent

Set the Agent's binding to
`{ "method": "credential_source", "sourceId": "cs_…" }`. The caller needs
`credential_source:operate` on the exact source. Deployment also requires the
Agent's service principal to have `operate` on it; grant it with a
[Namespace IAM](authorization.md#manage-namespace-policy) Role and an exact
`credential_source` AccessBinding. The principal needs no permission on the
underlying Secret. The worker rechecks both grants before it
provisions the revision. See [Harness execution](harness-execution.md#harness-authentication)
for the supported topology.

While a Credential Gateway is selected, deployment rejects `api_key`,
`codex_pat`, and `chatgpt_service_account` bindings with `409`. Guided Agent
provisioning does not yet accept credential sources; create the Agent, then
deploy it.

## Update a source

Updating the underlying Secret does not change the gateway's copy. To push a new
value, send
`PATCH /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId`. The
caller needs exact `credential_source:update` and `secret:operate` on every
Secret the update reads:

- An empty body `{}` re-reads the source's current Secrets.
- `{ "secrets": { "api_key": <SecretReference> } }` switches each named field to
  a replacement same-Namespace Secret. The field set stays the source type's
  catalog fields, and non-secret `config` cannot change; register a new source
  instead.

A successful update returns `200` with the source and its live gateway `status`.
Only a `ready` source can be updated. A gateway failure returns `503` and leaves
the Secret references unchanged. The gateway is updated before OCC commits, so
if the request fails after that, repeating the same request converges. If the
gateway no longer holds a copy (`absent`), the update also returns `503`;
delete the source and register it again.

Installations bootstrapped before `update` existed do not grant
`credential_source:update` to existing Roles. An administrator must add it to a
Role before anyone can update a source.

A running Agent keeps the previous value until its Harness restarts, because the
gateway gives updated values only to new processes. To rotate a key:

1. Update the Secret's value (`occ secret update`), or create a replacement
   Secret.
2. Run `occ credential-source update ID`, adding `--file` with replacement
   `secrets` if you created a new Secret.
3. Redeploy each Agent that uses the source.

## Withdraw a source from an Agent

Withdrawal revokes a source from an Agent's active revision while the revision
keeps running. Send
`POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId/withdraw`.
The caller needs `agent:operate`, and the active revision must authenticate with
that source. The request returns `202` with the withdrawal in state `pending`.
A replay returns the same withdrawal. It queues another attempt only if no
attempt is already queued or running.

The worker detaches the source from the revision's Sandbox and records
`revoked` only after the gateway confirms that the revision's placeholders no
longer resolve, even in running processes. Requests already forwarded upstream
are not undone. Read the state with
`GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId/withdrawal`,
which requires `agent:read`. It returns `requestedBy`, the principal whose
`agent:operate` the worker rechecks, and `reason` with `lastAttemptAt` for the
worker's latest attempt. A `pending` withdrawal with reason
`CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_PENDING` is waiting for the gateway; a Sandbox without a
running process never confirms revocation. `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` or
`ACTOR_REVOKED` means the requester lost `agent:operate`.

A withdrawn source never re-attaches to that revision; if its Sandbox is
recreated, provisioning fails with `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWN`. Maintenance of the
revision stops preparing it. While the withdrawal is `pending`, each
maintenance pass queues another attempt if none is outstanding. Once it is
`revoked`, maintenance stops, so Compute no longer repairs the revision until a
redeploy replaces it.

The revision still references the source, so the source cannot be deleted until
a redeploy replaces the revision. Redeploy the Agent with a replacement source
or another authentication method.

## Delete a source

`DELETE /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId`
requires exact `delete` and returns `204`:

- It returns `409` while an Agent draft, active revision, or pending deployment
  references the source.
- It marks the record `deleting` before it asks the gateway to remove its copy.
  A gateway failure returns `503` and leaves the record `deleting`. Send the same
  request again; an already-removed copy counts as deleted.
- Within 70 seconds of registration, deletion removes the copy but returns `503`
  and keeps the record, because a timed-out registration could still create a
  copy. Retry after that window.

While a source exists, including one in `deleting`, its Namespace cannot be
deleted, and its referenced Secrets cannot be deleted.
