# Credential sources

A credential source registers a Namespace Secret with the Installation's
selected [Credential Gateway](drivers/credential-gateway.md). The gateway keeps
its own copy of the value and applies it outside the Agent workload, so the
Harness never receives the real credential. An Agent uses a model source through
[`harnessAuth`](agents.md#harness-authentication) and other sources through its
`credentialSources` list.

Credential sources require a selected Credential Gateway. The only
implementation is the [OpenShell Credential Gateway](drivers/openshell-credential-gateway.md).
Its `openai` type authenticates dedicated Codex models, and its `bearer-token`
type carries a static token to one API endpoint. OpenShell is not a supported
production Agent path; see its
[qualification requirements](drivers/openshell-sandbox.md#qualification-contract).

## Register a source

1. Wait for the Namespace to become `ready`.
2. [Create a Secret](drivers/kubernetes-secret.md#create-a-namespace-owned-secret)
   that holds the value, and keep its `ref`.
3. Send `POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources`. The caller needs
   `credential_source:create` on the Namespace and `secret:operate` on every
   referenced Secret:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "openai-production",
     "type": "openai",
     "secrets": {
       "api_key": {
         "kind": "secret",
         "namespaceId": "ns_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000",
         "id": "sec_123e4567-e89b-42d3-a456-426614174000"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

A successful request returns `201` with the source metadata. Its `id` starts
with `cs_`, and `ref` is the reference used in Agent bindings. The response
includes the gateway's `status` but never a credential value.

The request fields are:

- `name`: required; unique within the Namespace.
- `type`: required; a type from the gateway catalog. A type the selected gateway
  does not offer fails with `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT` and a message naming the
  fix, before any gateway call.
- `config`: optional nonsecret strings keyed by catalog field name.
- `secrets`: Secret references keyed by catalog field name. Each Secret must
  belong to the same Namespace: a reference to another Namespace fails with
  `400 INVALID_REQUEST` before any Secret is read, and a reference to a Secret
  the Namespace does not hold fails with `404`.

OCC rejects unknown fields and missing required fields before it reads any
Secret. It reads each value through the Secret Driver, sends the values to the
gateway, and stores only the Secret references. OCC records the source as
`registering` before the gateway call. If the gateway rejects the registration,
OCC deletes any copy and the record. If the call fails without an answer, such as
on a timeout, a copy may still appear later, so the record stays listed as
`deleting`; send DELETE to remove it.

## Read and list sources

`GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId` requires
exact `read`. It returns the record plus live `status` from the gateway:
`ready`, `pending`, `failed`, or `absent`, with an optional `reason`. If the
gateway cannot answer, `status` is `failed` with a fixed reason; the read still
succeeds.

`GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources` requires Namespace `read`
and returns only sources on which the caller has exact `read`. Lists
do not call the gateway and omit `status`.

The record's `state` is `registering`, `ready`, or `deleting`. A source left
`registering` by an interrupted request never becomes usable; delete it to
remove any gateway copy. A `registering` or `deleting` source cannot be
bound or deployed.

## Bind a source to an Agent

List every source the Agent uses in its `credentialSources`, up to eight
entries of `{ "sourceId": "cs_…" }`, on create or update. An update replaces the
list, `[]` removes it, and a source cannot appear twice. Any catalog type can be
listed.

To have the Harness authenticate its model with a source, also set
`harnessAuth` to `{ "method": "credential_source", "sourceId": "cs_…" }`. It
names one listed entry whose catalog type has `harnessAuth`; it does not bind
the source separately. A request that names an unlisted source, or removes the
named source from the list, fails with `400` "The Harness credential source must
be listed in the Agent's credentialSources." after the grant checks below.

The caller needs `credential_source:operate` on each exact
source, including any the update removes. Every source a request lists, including
one it keeps, must be `ready` and registered through the selected Credential
Gateway. Sources the Agent already binds need only `operate`, so after the
Installation selects another Credential Gateway, an update that leaves
`credentialSources` out still succeeds, and one that sets `harnessAuth` to
another method or source and lists only new sources, or `[]`, removes the old
ones. Listing an old source again fails with `503`, and so does deploying an
Agent that still lists one; see [After a Credential Gateway change](#after-a-credential-gateway-change). Deployment also requires the Agent's
service principal to have `operate` on each source; grant it with a
[Namespace IAM](authorization.md#manage-namespace-policy) Role and an exact
`credential_source` AccessBinding. The principal needs no permission on the
underlying Secret. The worker rechecks both grants before it
provisions the revision. On an Installation with no Credential Gateway, binding
any source fails with `409 CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_NOT_CONFIGURED`, as registration
does, once the caller holds `operate` on it. The paired Sandbox applies the
sources, and a Credential Gateway requires a Sandbox Driver, so on an
Installation without one, deploying an Agent that binds a source normally fails
with that `409 CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_NOT_CONFIGURED`. Only an Agent whose
`harnessAuth` names no source, but whose list kept sources from an earlier
configuration, fails first with `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT` "Agent credential
sources require a selected Sandbox Driver." See [Harness execution](harness-execution.md#harness-authentication)
for the supported topology.

While a Credential Gateway is selected, deployment rejects `api_key` and
`codex_pat` bindings (both Secret and ServiceAccount sources) with `409`. Guided Agent
provisioning rejects credential sources with `400`; create the Agent, then
deploy it.

## Update a source

Updating the underlying Secret does not change the gateway's copy. To push a new
value, send
`PATCH /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId`. The
caller needs exact `credential_source:update` and `secret:operate` on every
Secret the update reads:

- An empty body `{}` re-reads the source's current Secrets.
- `{ "secrets": { "api_key": <SecretReference> } }` switches each named field to
  a replacement same-Namespace Secret. The field set stays the source type's
  catalog fields, and non-secret `config` cannot change; register a new source
  instead.

A successful update returns `200` with the source and its live gateway `status`.
Only a `ready` source can be updated. A gateway failure returns `503` and leaves
the Secret references unchanged. The gateway is updated before OCC commits, so
if the request fails after that, repeating the same request converges. If the
gateway no longer holds a copy (`absent`), the update also returns `503`;
delete the source and register it again.

Migration `0048_administrator_credential_source_grants` adds the current
`credential_source` grants, including `update`, to an unchanged built-in
Installation administrator Role from an earlier bootstrap. Other Roles keep
their exact grants; grant `update` through a Namespace Role where needed.

A running Agent keeps the previous value until its Harness restarts, because the
gateway gives updated values only to new processes. To rotate a key:

1. Update the Secret's value (`occ secret update`), or create a replacement
   Secret.
2. Run `occ credential-source update ID`, adding `--file` with replacement
   `secrets` if you created a new Secret.
3. Redeploy each Agent that uses the source.

## Withdraw a source from an Agent

Withdrawal revokes a source from an Agent's active revision while the revision
keeps running. Send
`POST /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId/withdraw`.
The caller needs `agent:operate`, and the active revision must have been
admitted with that source, as its Harness authentication or in
`credentialSources`. The request returns `202` with the withdrawal in state `pending`.
A deployment admitted with the source but not yet active gets its own
withdrawal, so it never attaches the source. A withdrawn Harness source fails
that deployment with `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWN`; otherwise it activates without the
source, and the read below then returns its withdrawal. An earlier revision
that still runs because the active revision's deployment has not finished
replacing it gets its own withdrawal too. A replay returns the
same withdrawal and makes the caller its `requestedBy`. It queues another
attempt only if none is queued or running; a queued attempt runs at once.

The worker detaches the source from the revision's Sandbox and records
`revoked` only after the gateway confirms that the revision's placeholders no
longer resolve, even in running processes. Requests already forwarded upstream
are not undone. Read the state with
`GET /namespaces/:namespaceId/agents/:agentId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId/withdrawal`,
which requires `agent:read`. It returns `requestedBy`, the principal whose
`agent:operate` the worker rechecks, `reason` with `lastAttemptAt` for the
worker's latest attempt, and `withdrawalInProgress`, which is `true` while an
attempt is queued or running. A `pending` withdrawal with reason
`CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_PENDING` is waiting for the gateway; a Sandbox without a
running process never confirms revocation. `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` or
`ACTOR_REVOKED` means the requester lost `agent:operate`; another operator can
send the withdraw request again to retry it on their own authority.
`CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_MISCONFIGURED` or `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT`
means Compute cannot reach the revision's Sandbox as configured, or found an
object it does not own; the attempt fails without retries, even with
maintenance. Correct the cause, then send the request again.

The worker retries an unconfirmed withdrawal a few times with backoff
(`OCC_WORKER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`; by default about 12 seconds). If those attempts run
out because the gateway is unreachable or has not confirmed revocation (or the
last attempt outlived its worker's claim, after a worker restart or a hung
gateway call), and Compute has no maintenance (the Kubernetes Compute Driver
has none), the worker queues another series 30 seconds later, then after 1, 2
and 4 minutes, then every 5 minutes, 15 series in all (about an hour).
Meanwhile the read shows `pending`, the latest `reason`, and
`withdrawalInProgress: true`, and the source still resolves in the Sandbox. The first series the gateway confirms
records `revoked`, with no replay needed. A withdraw request sent while a
series waits queues nothing more; the series runs at once, on the caller's
authority.

When the last series fails, or every withdrawal left on the revision is denied
to its requester, the withdrawal stays `pending` with
`withdrawalInProgress: false`. Nothing retries it on its own unless the
revision has maintenance (see below). Send the withdraw request again to queue
another attempt, with its own series.

A withdrawn source never re-attaches to that revision. If its Sandbox is
recreated, a withdrawn source is left out and the revision keeps running
without it, unless `harnessAuth` names it. If a Sandbox create that started
before the withdrawal finishes after it, the next deployment or maintenance
pass detaches the source again. A withdrawn Harness source instead fails provisioning with
`CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWN`, and maintenance of the revision stops preparing it. While any
withdrawal is `pending`, each maintenance pass queues another attempt if none is
outstanding. Maintenance does not recheck grants on withdrawn sources, which never
attach again, so removing one cannot stop it. After model-source withdrawal,
maintenance never prepares the revision again. It continues recovering pending
tool withdrawals even when the model source is already `revoked`, and stops only when every withdrawal is `revoked`.
Redeploy to resume Compute repair.

Withdrawals of different sources on one revision share one worker attempt, but
each is authorized by its own `requestedBy`. A requester who lost
`agent:operate` leaves only their withdrawal `pending` with
`AUTHORIZATION_DENIED`; the others are still revoked.

The revision still references the source, so the source cannot be deleted until
a redeploy replaces the revision. Redeploy the Agent with a replacement source
or another authentication method.

## Delete a source

`DELETE /namespaces/:namespaceId/credential-sources/:credentialSourceId`
requires exact `delete` and returns `204`:

- It returns `409 RESOURCE_CONFLICT` while an Agent draft, active revision, or
  pending deployment references the source. Remove it from those Agents and
  redeploy, or delete them.
- When only a withdrawal attempt or retry series, queued or running for a
  revision that held the source, blocks it, the `409` is
  `CREDENTIAL_WITHDRAWAL_IN_PROGRESS`. A withdrawal that never confirms keeps
  its series queued for up to about an hour, even after a redeploy, and the
  withdraw request no longer applies once the active revision drops the
  source. Wait for the series to finish, or delete the Agent: a completed Agent
  deletion drops that work.
- On an Installation with no Credential Gateway it returns
  `409 CREDENTIAL_GATEWAY_NOT_CONFIGURED`, and for a source the selected driver
  did not register it returns `503`; neither changes the record.
- It marks the record `deleting` before it asks the gateway to remove its copy.
  A gateway failure returns `503` and leaves the record `deleting`. Send the same
  request again; an already-removed copy counts as deleted.
- Within 70 seconds of registration, deletion removes the copy but returns `503`
  and keeps the record, because a timed-out registration could still create a
  copy. Retry after that window.

While a source exists, including one in `deleting`, its Namespace cannot be
deleted, and its referenced Secrets cannot be deleted.

## After a Credential Gateway change

A source belongs to the Credential Gateway Driver that registered it. After the
Installation selects another driver in `drivers.credential_gateway`, binding,
deploying, updating, or deleting an old source returns
`503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` with one fixed message: "The selected Credential
Gateway Driver did not register this credential source. …". OCC answers it only
after the caller's grant and the source lookup. `GET` on such a source reports a
`failed` status whose reason names the driver change.

- To keep an Agent running, register a replacement source through the selected
  driver, list it in place of the old one, and deploy again.
- To delete an old source, an administrator changes the Installation
  configuration to select the driver ID that registered it again, deletes the
  source, then selects the new driver. The same steps finish a source that an earlier release left
  `deleting` after a gateway change, which otherwise keeps its Namespace and
  Secrets from being deleted.
