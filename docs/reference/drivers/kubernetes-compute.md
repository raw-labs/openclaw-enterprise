# Kubernetes Compute Driver

The Kubernetes Compute Driver runs OpenClaw Agents on Kubernetes. It provisions
or adopts one namespace per tenant in a single cluster and creates an OpenClaw
gateway for each deployed Agent. Dedicated Gateways and Harnesses use separate
Pods, identities and volumes within that namespace; embedded OpenClaw combines
them in one Pod.
The experimental `executionCluster` configuration selects a second Kubernetes
API for dedicated Harness resources. See the [two-cluster validation profile](../../testing/two-cluster-local.md)
before using it; cloud deployment and complete runtime acceptance remain pending.

New managed tenant namespaces are named `oce-` plus the first 15 hexadecimal
characters of the Namespace ID's SHA-256 digest: stable, DNS-safe, and short
enough for an OpenShell pre.5 operator Workspace name. An existing managed
namespace with the earlier `oce-<slug>-<hash12>` name remains valid only when
discovery finds its exact tenant label, matching `namespace-id`
annotation, and OpenClaw manager label; the Driver never creates that form.
Wrong names or duplicate tenant claims fail closed. An explicitly adopted
namespace keeps its operator-selected name; OpenShell selection rejects it if it
exceeds that Workspace limit.

The optional [OpenShell Sandbox Driver](openshell-sandbox.md) is designed to
own dedicated Codex and native OpenClaw Harness Pods while Compute keeps the
other resources. Dedicated native OpenClaw is rejected unless the selected
SandboxDriver provisions the Harness and declares networking, filesystem, and
process containment. Stock OpenShell cannot provide required credential and
workload-identity projections; Agent deployment with OpenShell remains unsupported.

Detailed operator contracts:

- [Storage and credentials](kubernetes-compute/storage-and-credentials.md): separate gateway state, Harness workspaces, and runtime Secrets.
- [Networking and isolation](kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md): DNS, private gateway routes, and tenant namespace ownership.

## Existing split-layout installations

An in-place upgrade from separate Gateway and Harness namespaces is not supported.
API and worker startup preflight refuses a single-cluster installation containing
an `oce-gateways-<hash>` storage namespace without the tenant discovery label.
This check runs before tenant reconciliation; it does not move or delete runtime
resources. The experimental two-cluster profile retains its separate target.

Before replacing the controller images, inspect the existing storage targets:

```sh
kubectl get namespaces -l openclaw.dev/gateway-namespace -L openclaw.dev/namespace
```

In a single cluster, a row with an empty `NAMESPACE` column is a split-layout
tenant. The two-cluster profile's control-cluster rows are expected.

No migration moves split-layout tenants. Export, delete and re-create them
through OCC with the steps in the
[breaking-change notice](../../guides/deploy/breaking-changes.md#2026-10-05-split-layout-tenants-block-the-controller-upgrade);
chat history and Harness workspace state are not carried over. Do not delete
the old namespace, remove its storage-role label or add a tenant label to
bypass preflight: the Gateway's private state and UID-bound credential
references would not move.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes 1.35 or later. On an older API server, API and worker startup each
  emit `compute.preflight-warning` with the observed and minimum versions, then
  continue; versions below 1.35 are outside the supported and CI-verified boundary.
- A Kubernetes cluster dedicated to one OpenClaw Enterprise Installation; shared
  clusters are not supported.
- Enforced Kubernetes NetworkPolicies, verified Kubernetes API TLS, and
  restricted Pod security.
- Separate controller API and worker ServiceAccounts with operator-managed,
  tenant-local permissions.
- API and worker permission to `GET` the Kubernetes `/version` non-resource URL,
  granted by the production chart's narrowly scoped startup Namespace ClusterRoles.
- Approved, digest-pinned gateway and Agent images.
- Explicit container resource limits, namespace quotas, DNS settings, approved
  proxy clients, and `network.gatewayTrustedProxyCidrs` for gateway trust.
  Native workspace initialization uses `resources.gateway`, including in dedicated
  Harness Pods, because it loads the OpenClaw CLI.
- For real gateways in either topology, an explicitly selected
  `runtime.gatewayStorageClassName` for a private disk supporting `10Gi`
  `ReadWriteOnce` filesystem claims (`local-path` in the disposable k3d suite).
  Check the [gateway disk requirements](kubernetes-compute/storage-and-credentials.md#gateway-storage)
  before selecting a production StorageClass.
- For dedicated Agents, a default StorageClass that supports `40Gi`
  `ReadWriteOnce` PersistentVolumeClaims.
- If `runtime.codexSeccompProfile` is configured, install that relative
  localhost seccomp profile on every eligible node before Agent startup;
  Kubernetes fails the Codex Pod when it is missing.

The worker manages PersistentVolumeClaims and, when private gateway routing is
enabled, HTTPRoutes through tenant-local RoleBindings. Only the controller API
issues provider credentials. The worker reads admitted transport/channel material
and maintains revision-owned Harness Secret projections in the tenant namespace.
The API does not need gateway Pod reads, exec, route writes, or certificate
management for workspace-file access. Do not grant wildcard permissions,
cluster-wide access to tenant resources, workload access to controller
credentials, or permission to create or escalate RoleBindings.

With OpenShell sandboxing enabled, the optional `SandboxDriver.ensureNamespace`
hook uses the Compute Driver's Kubernetes access directly; there is no separate
SandboxDriver Kubernetes access adapter. The hook applies approved
namespace-scoped OpenShell labels and NetworkPolicy resources, checks OpenShell
gateway readiness, and creates or adopts the Namespace Workspace. Harness
provisioning and cleanup follow the [SandboxDriver lifecycle](sandbox.md#admission-and-lifecycle):
revision cleanup runs even when Compute's ordinary Harness Deployment is absent,
and a failed provider Namespace cleanup keeps the Kubernetes namespace.
Provider-owned Harness removal stays with the provider, so Compute needs no
Sandbox custom-resource permissions.
Allow privileged OpenShell init or sidecar containers only through an
operator-approved RuntimeClass or equivalent admission exemption with a matching
fail-closed policy ([admission requirements](openshell-sandbox.md#kubernetes-and-admission-requirements));
the Harness container itself remains unprivileged.

A provider-owned dedicated Harness is ready only when exactly one live Pod in
the resolved namespace carries the Agent, revision, and `agent` workload-role
labels used by the active Service selector, plus all supplied Harness
requirement labels, and reports `Ready=True`. Zero candidates, multiple live
candidates (including one Ready and one unready), or a single unready candidate
leave preparation at `ready: false` and prevent activation. Pods with a valid
deletion timestamp, in another namespace, or with another Agent, revision, or
role do not count.

Malformed or incomplete Pod-list observations raise an error, including invalid
identity or condition fields, duplicate condition types, contradictory Harness
requirement labels, and pagination indicating more results. Missing optional
Pod status or conditions means not ready. Preparation errors run the existing
workload cleanup hooks; activation errors occur before changing routing.
A cancelled observation cannot report ready. The check covers Kubernetes workload readiness and label uniqueness; it does not attest a
provider Sandbox ID or Pod UID, authenticate the guest, or fence a runtime
generation.

## Configuration

Select the Kubernetes Compute Driver in the Installation startup YAML. Set
`OCC_CONFIG_PATH` to that file's absolute path for both the controller API and
worker.

```yaml

        agent: registry.example/openclaw-codex@sha256:bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
        requireImmutableDigest: true
      resources:
        gateway:

          limits: { cpu: "4", memory: 3Gi }
        agent:
          requests: { cpu: 100m, memory: 768Mi }
          limits: { cpu: "4", memory: 6Gi }

        # Replace with verified source CIDRs for your authenticated proxy.
        gatewayTrustedProxyCidrs: ["<actual-proxy-source-cidr>"]
        gatewayClients:
          - namespace: openclaw-system
            podLabels: { app: approved-gateway-client }
      servicePrincipalCredentials:
        mode: projectedServiceAccountToken
        audience: openclaw-enterprise
        expirationSeconds: 900
      runtime:
        gatewayStorageClassName: sqlite-block
        nativeOpenClawSessionCapacity: 8
        nodeSelector: { oce-role: agents }
        gatewayNodeSelector: { oce-role: control-plane }
        transportSecretPrefix: openclaw-agent-transport
        # Optional; first install this reviewed profile on every eligible node.
        codexSeccompProfile: profiles/codex-0.160.0.json
```

This is only the Compute Driver portion of the Installation configuration; the
[complete production Installation example](../../guides/deploy/production-installation.md#configure-the-installation)
adds the other required Drivers and settings.

`runtime.nativeOpenClawSessionCapacity` accepts an integer from `1` through
`1024` and defaults to `8`. It bounds retained native OpenClaw session workers
in one AgentRevision Sandbox. Stopping a hosted session releases its slot; saved
history does not consume capacity. OpenClaw does not yet retire idle paired-node
workers, so size the limit against the Agent workload's CPU and memory limits.

### Authentication

Choose exactly one Kubernetes authentication mode:

- `inCluster` uses the controller Pod's ServiceAccount and the cluster
  certificate authority.
- `kubeconfig` requires an explicit `kubeconfigPath` and named `context`.

The driver does not fall back to the ambient kubeconfig or current context.
Kubernetes API certificates must be verified in either mode.

### Images and resources

Configure Gateway and Agent images, resource requests/limits, namespace quotas
and container defaults. `runtime.nodeSelector` selects Harness and embedded Pods;
dedicated real Gateways require `runtime.gatewayNodeSelector`, including their
private-state initializer. Use disjoint trusted and tenant node pools in
production. Quotas and defaults cover both roles in a shared tenant namespace;
the two-cluster profile applies them separately to each physical target. The
[installation profiles](../../guides/deploy/installation-profiles.md) explain
the measured memory defaults. Production requires
`images.requireImmutableDigest: true` and lowercase `@sha256:` image digests.
Quote whole-core quantities, such as `cpu: "4"`.

See [network configuration](kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md#networking)
for DNS, gateway clients, proxy trust, and egress requirements.

## Execution modes

Each Agent-owned gateway Deployment has exactly one desired replica and uses
`Recreate`: Kubernetes stops the previous Pod before starting its replacement,
so gateway rollout can cause transient downtime. Neither Kubernetes Deployment nor OCC routing provides node-level process
fencing during partitions or manual replacement.

The Agent's Harness configuration determines its execution topology:

- **Embedded:** OpenClaw runs the gateway and Harness in one Pod. It accepts
  an Agent-scoped model API key, uses `openai/` models, and does not require
  shared storage.
- **Dedicated:** The gateway and Codex Harness run in separate Pods in the same
  tenant namespace, with separate ServiceAccounts and storage. They communicate through
  authenticated app-server transport. The Gateway uses fully qualified Harness
  Service DNS and the paired node for workspace operations. Codex accepts an
  Agent-scoped model API key or a managed ChatGPT service-account credential,
  and permits `openai/` or `codex/` models.
- **Dedicated native OpenClaw:** The gateway and paired OpenClaw Harness run in
  separate Pods with separate ServiceAccounts. Compute issues a node-only setup
  credential through the gateway and stores the resulting device identity on the
  Harness workspace claim. The node host supervises the remote worker, which owns
  the agent loop, model inference, and coding tools. Only the Harness receives the
  model API key. Compute makes its generated `dedicated-native` worker-inference
  profile mandatory, so sessions use the enrolled Harness without a Cloud Worker
  selection. A missing or disconnected Harness fails the turn without gateway
  inference fallback. Explicit `openai/` models require complete API,
  token-limit, input, reasoning, and cost metadata at the approved
  `https://api.openai.com/v1` endpoint.

Dedicated replacement opts into the [exclusive preparation contract](compute.md#production-revision-stages):
the worker stops predecessors before starting the new Harness. This permits RWO
workspace storage and introduces deployment downtime; restore a previous
configuration through a new revision instead of restarting its old snapshot.

Enabled external channels require dedicated execution. Unsupported Harness and
execution-mode combinations fail deployment. Embedded OpenClaw is never
delegated to OpenShell.

Stopping an Agent first deletes its exact gateway route and gateway runtime,
then removes the dedicated Harness Deployment or delegates provider-owned
Harness removal; selected Sandbox revision cleanup follows as described above.
Stop retains Agent-owned PersistentVolumeClaims and runtime credential Secrets;
retirement is the destructive revision cleanup. Repeated stop
observes exact ownership and converges when the runtime objects are already
absent.

### Plugin startup status

Compute-owned embedded or dedicated OpenClaw and dedicated Codex runtimes publish a private
current-startup result after attempting requested plugins and verifying effective
configuration. It identifies the revision, runtime instance, successful
selection IDs, and the [plugin warnings](../agent-plugins.md#lifecycle)
(`PLUGIN_INSTALL_FAILED` or `PLUGIN_AUTH_REQUIRED`) for disabled selections.

Kubernetes Compute reads the exact owned workload's status endpoint through the
authenticated Kubernetes Pod proxy, which tenant-local controller RBAC permits;
workload ServiceAccounts receive no Kubernetes write credentials. The endpoint
is not part of the public gateway API. Compute validates workload ownership,
startup identity, admitted selection keys, and closed warning codes. Missing,
malformed, or foreign status cannot establish readiness.

For embedded OpenClaw, startup explicitly disables failed plugin entries and
removes their managed tool allowances before starting the gateway. For dedicated
Codex, the separate gateway applies the Agent's current result to its bridge
configuration before serving and refreshes that configuration after a changed
restart result. Failed-only Codex app bindings are disabled; successful selections
retain their admitted policy, including shared app bindings they require.

The Codex app-server credential derives from the Agent's transport Secret,
revision, and startup identity, so a gateway configured for the previous startup
cannot authenticate to a restarted Agent. Its supervisor obtains the new status,
applies the matching exclusions, and respawns the gateway process with the new
credential, closing the interval before its next status poll.

The worker records warnings with successful deployment completion under its live
claim; a runtime restart recomputes status instead of preserving the first
failure. There are no plugin receipt ConfigMaps, Pod finalizers, failure latches,
or post-commit acknowledgment steps. This behavior does not change requested revision
selections, uninstall account-wide plugins, or promise rollback.

### Current runtime diagnostics

Kubernetes Compute implements the optional deployment diagnostics contract. OCC
authorizes the exact Agent and revision, then the Driver reads the owned
runtime Pods through the Kubernetes apiserver Pod proxy. The private runtime
endpoint returns bounded generic checks for the requested revision. The API needs
Pod `get`/`list` and `pods/proxy` `get` permission in each runtime namespace.
Both roles are read in the tenant namespace for a single cluster. The two-cluster
profile reads dedicated Gateways in its control-cluster Gateway namespace. The chart adds these read permissions to the
unbound tenant API and Gateway observer roles; operators retain control of their
namespace-local bindings.
Missing Pods or unavailable private endpoints report unknown diagnostic checks
instead of mutating deployment status. The Agent container currently returns no
channel checks.

The bundled gateway maps Slack channel status into configuration,
authentication, and connectivity checks. They exclude raw Slack responses,
credential values, logs, and message text, and never post a message or run a
model turn.

## Failure conditions

- **Namespace provisioning fails:** Verify tenant-local RoleBindings, namespace
  ownership labels, restricted Pod Security labels, and enforced
  NetworkPolicies in each selected tenant target. Existing
  namespaces also require external lifecycle ownership, exclusive tenant use,
  and no foreign NetworkPolicies.
- **Gateway or Harness remains pending:** Check image digests, image pull
  permissions, CPU and memory limits, namespace quotas, required Secrets, and
  workload readiness, including the
  [network profile](kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md#explicit-network-profiles)
  label. Dedicated Codex Harness containers clear the plugin readiness marker at
  process start, so a marker from a previous container attempt cannot make a
  restarted runtime ready. Access-token login retries only native process
  timeouts, up to three 30-second attempts. Exhausted startup remains unready
  until an explicit restart; see the
  [authentication probe contract](../harness-execution.md#harness-authentication)
  for model-probe retries and sanitized attempt logs.
  Native plugin startup, authentication, transport, and installation failures
  remain generic workload startup failures unless the Compute-owned runtime
  reports a verified current-startup warning for an admitted selected plugin.
- **Gateway storage is pending or rejected:** Check the configured
  `runtime.gatewayStorageClassName`, available `10Gi` capacity, filesystem
  support, worker PVC permissions, and the PVC's exact ownership. Preserve
  data when resolving an incompatible or foreign claim; the driver does not
  adopt or convert it.
- **Dedicated Harness cannot start:** Verify that the default StorageClass can
  provision a `40Gi` `ReadWriteOnce` claim and that the worker can manage
  PersistentVolumeClaims in the tenant namespace.
- **Agent configuration is rejected:** Confirm the selected Harness supports
  its execution mode; external channels and provider-issued access tokens
  require dedicated execution.
- **Approved traffic fails or denied traffic succeeds:** Verify NetworkPolicy
  enforcement, configured DNS selectors, gateway-client selectors, and any
  configured channel proxy address.
- **Production startup fails:** Confirm the controller API and worker share the
  same `OCC_CONFIG_PATH`, image digests are immutable, Kubernetes credentials
  are valid, and required runtime Secret prefixes are configured.

## Selected-driver lifecycle hooks

The Driver invokes selected non-Compute lifecycle hooks around Namespace
preparation and workload startup or teardown. Hooks receive the current
operation's cancellation signal; a failed revocation blocks resource teardown.
The [ComputeDriver contract](compute.md#optional-selected-driver-hooks) owns the
hook ordering and environment restrictions, and the
[lifecycle-hook flow](../../flows/compute-driver-lifecycle-hooks.md) traces the
implementation.
