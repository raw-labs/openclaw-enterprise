# Development OCC API reference

<!-- Generated from packages/contracts/openapi/occ-api.openapi.json. Do not edit directly. -->

Version `0.1.0`; OpenAPI `3.1.0`.

This reference is generated from the
[checked-in OpenAPI contract](../../packages/contracts/openapi/occ-api.openapi.json).
Run `pnpm openapi:generate` after changing an API route or schema;
`pnpm openapi:check` verifies the generated contract, this reference,
and the [API cheat sheet](cheatsheets/api.md).

The exported contract comes from the development-enabled OCC app, which is
why the generated title is `Development OCC API`. Use
`POST /installation/bootstrap` only for development or bootstrap flows
that create the first Installation; production bootstraps through the
[Helm initialization Job](../guides/deploy/production-installation.md#provision-system-secrets-and-install)
before serving requests.
After bootstrap, production uses the same authenticated controller resource
operations through the selected Drivers and settings described in
[settings](settings.md).

See [authentication](authentication.md) for supported credentials and their scope.

#### `POST /api/auth/accounts`

<span id="post-apiauthaccounts"></span>

Create an administrator-controlled local auth account

**Operation ID:** `createAuthAccount`

**Permissions:** Requires administer permission on the Installation. Creates a Better Auth account and an explicit IAM Principal in one transaction. Supplying roleId also creates a binding to that existing IAM Role; omitting roleId creates no grants. Public signup remains disabled. An optional github.subject attaches that GitHub identity in the same transaction; it conflicts when GitHub sign-in is not configured or the identity is already assigned.

**Operation ID:** `signInEmail`

**Permissions:** Authenticates a local account and issues a user session cookie. In the password-only profile, repeated failed attempts for one email, or from one client address behind a trusted proxy, are limited and return 429; with GitHub, Google or OIDC sign-in, every attempt counts, successful ones included. A successful sign-in also sets an HttpOnly known-device cookie; later attempts for that email from the same browser spend the browser's own budget instead of the email's. The cookie never authenticates.
