# OCC metrics

The production Helm chart enables metrics on each OpenClaw Control Plane (OCC)
API and worker by default; direct process and development defaults remain off.
Each enabled process serves `GET /metrics` on a private listener. Use the
[development walkthrough](../testing/metrics.md) for Prometheus and Grafana,
or [production scraping](../guides/observability/metrics.md) for Kubernetes.

## Configuration and access

| Setting               | Contract                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OCC_METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` or `false`; defaults to `false`.                                                    |
| `OCC_METRICS_HOST`    | Required when enabled: `127.0.0.1` or `::1` in development; explicit Pod IP in production. |
| `OCC_METRICS_PORT`    | Required when enabled: integer 1–65535, distinct from the API port.                        |

Supplying host or port while disabled fails startup. An invalid configuration or
failed bind fails startup. Listener shutdown follows process shutdown. Metrics
are independent of log level and the logging Collector's port 8888.

The listener serves no sessions or resource operations and does not invoke IAM.
Network isolation protects the aggregate operational data. Exposition uses
Prometheus text, `Cache-Control: no-store`, and the client content type. Other
paths return 404; other methods on `/metrics` return 405. Connections are limited
to 16, with five-second socket/request handling limits. No public ingress.

## Application families

All families have `service="api|worker"`. No tenant, Agent, request, revision,
actor, credential, Driver-instance, payload, raw URL, or user-defined labels.

| Family                                        | Type      | Additional labels                 | Meaning                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `occ_http_requests_total`                     | Counter   | `route`, `method`, `status_class` | Completed API-process responses, including auth, console, denied and failing requests.   |
| `occ_http_request_duration_seconds`           | Histogram | `route`, `method`                 | Request-hook to response-completion seconds.                                             |
| `occ_reconciliation_attempts_total`           | Counter   | `work_kind`, `outcome`            | Finished passes processing claimed work.                                                 |
| `occ_reconciliation_attempt_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `work_kind`                       | Processing seconds, including Driver calls and finalization.                             |
| `occ_work_pending`                            | Gauge     | None                              | Shared PostgreSQL count of queued/claimed work, including delayed retries.               |
| `occ_agents`                                  | Gauge     | `lifecycle_state`                 | Persisted Agent reconciliation lifecycle; see below.                                     |
| `occ_agent_operation_duration_seconds`        | Histogram | `operation`                       | Admission to successful deployment or stop completion, including queue wait and retries. |
| `occ_work_oldest_pending_age_seconds`         | Gauge     | None                              | Age since admission of the oldest queued/claimed item; zero when no work is pending.     |

HTTP excludes health probes, metrics scrapes, and disconnected requests without
a completed response. `route` is the registered template or `unmatched`; wildcard
routes stay templates. Methods are `GET|HEAD|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE|OPTIONS|OTHER`;
status classes are `1xx|2xx|3xx|4xx|5xx|other`. Status classes cannot distinguish
401/403 from other 4xx failures. These are not model-turn or WebSocket durations.

Work kinds are `namespace_ensure|namespace_delete|agent_revision|agent_stop|agent_delete|agent_credential_withdrawal`. Outcomes are
`success|pending|retry|permanent|claim_lost|error`. Pending convergence, retries,
maintenance, and superseded work may generate multiple passes per deployment.
Durations exclude queue wait and time between passes. Idle polling and stale
recovery without a claimed processing pass are excluded. Process death can lose
observations; these counters are not durable audit evidence.

HTTP histogram boundaries in seconds: `0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10`. Work boundaries: `0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60,
120, 300, 900`. Both add `+Inf`, count, and sum.

## Shared snapshots and outages

Each worker scrape collects all gauges in one read-only PostgreSQL statement
against the singleton Installation. Every lifecycle category exists even at zero;
each Agent counts once. The projection uses desired runtime state, the latest
admitted revision, and deployment/stop/delete work:

| State       | Meaning                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `draft`     | No revision, stop, or deletion request has been admitted.                                                                              |
| `deploying` | Running is desired and the latest deployment is pending or not selected. Includes redeployment while an older revision remains active. |
| `running`   | The selected latest deployment has completed. This does not prove continuous runtime health.                                           |
| `stopping`  | Deletion is pending, or stopped is desired with an active pointer or unfinished deployment/stop work.                                  |
| `stopped`   | Stop has converged; revision history and Agent records remain.                                                                         |
| `failed`    | The latest operation for the desired state failed permanently. Includes retained Agents whose deletion cleanup failed.                 |

Successful deletion removes the Agent from inventory.

Maintenance work does not change these lifecycle categories. Collection never
polls Compute or updates resource state. Queue depth and oldest age include
delayed retries and scheduled maintenance, even before their next eligible time.
Age uses the original work admission timestamp, not the latest attempt, and is
clamped at zero for clock skew.

Operation durations have `operation="deploy|stop"`. The completing worker records
one observation after successful queue finalization, including final activation
and predecessor retirement for deployments. Retry and convergence delays count;
maintenance, superseded operations, and permanent failures do not. Repeated stops
that find the Agent already stopped still count as completed stop requests.
Both bounded operation label sets start at zero so the first completion can
contribute to rates. Buckets in seconds are `0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30,
45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 450, 600, 900, 1800` plus `+Inf`, count, and
sum, resolving deployments from one second to the 900-second convergence
deadline. Per-phase deployment timing is in the worker's
[`worker.completed` log](controller.md#observability). The timer uses wall-clock admission time and clamps
negative elapsed time to zero. Process death between commit and observation can
lose a sample; observations are operational metrics, not durable audit evidence.

Worker startup supplies a separate read-only application-role pool with maximum
one connection, a 500 ms connection deadline, and 1500 ms query/statement
deadlines. Concurrent scrapes share collection. Failed collections destroy the
affected connection and return 503 without partial exposition or a stale-value
fallback. Reconciliation uses its own pool and continues. API scrapes do not
query the database.

## Process families and series budget

The pinned `@prometheus-io/client@0.16.1` supplies defaults. OCC retains only:

- `occ_process_cpu_user_seconds_total`, `occ_process_cpu_system_seconds_total`,
  `occ_process_cpu_seconds_total`, `occ_process_start_time_seconds`,
  `occ_process_resident_memory_bytes`.
- `occ_nodejs_heap_size_total_bytes`, `occ_nodejs_heap_size_used_bytes`,
  `occ_nodejs_external_memory_bytes`.
- `occ_nodejs_eventloop_lag_seconds` and
  `occ_nodejs_eventloop_lag_{min,max,mean,stddev,p50,p90,p99}_seconds`.
- `occ_nodejs_version_info` with bounded `version`, `major`, `minor`, `patch`
  metadata; `occ_nodejs_gc_duration_seconds` with
  `kind="major|minor|incremental|weakcb"` and boundaries
  `0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 5` seconds plus `+Inf`, count, and sum.

Unsupported platform measurements may be absent. No handle/resource breakdowns,
heap-space labels, custom labels, configurable buckets, or exemplars. Client
upgrades must explicitly review this list; new defaults are filtered out.

For `R` observed registered route/method pairs, HTTP has at most `20R` series
(six statuses plus fourteen histogram series). Unmatched methods add at most
eight pairs. Worker application metrics have at most 136 series (30 outcomes,
70 pass-duration series, 28 operation-duration series, and eight gauges). Process collectors add at most 53 series
per process. Do not preallocate the route/status Cartesian product.

## Replica aggregation

Prometheus scrapes every Pod directly and assigns instance/deployment labels.
Sum `rate()` of counters; sum histogram buckets before `histogram_quantile()`.
Use `max` for duplicated shared gauges, filtering targets by `up == 1` and
retaining deployment identity. Independent snapshot times can temporarily
overestimate decreasing values; missing/failed targets mean unknown, not zero.
Memory can be summed for fleet use or maximized for the largest process.
Inspect event-loop percentiles per process; do not average them.
