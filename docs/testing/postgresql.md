# PostgreSQL tests

Verify persistence, authentication, queue behavior, and bootstrap against
disposable PostgreSQL databases. Start with the [shared requirements](README.md#requirements-and-credentials).

## Revision-worker tests

Run the revision-worker suite with an owned PostgreSQL
fixture. It allocates disposable databases under that run's owner so another
test cannot consume its queue. Four cross-Namespace cases explicitly share
a database within their test. Tests still connect as `occ_app`; preparation
uses the existing administrator and migrator paths. The suite rejects a standalone
`OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL` without prepared ownership before changing that database.
Other direct PostgreSQL suites retain their application-role URL setup below.

From the repository root, after the shared requirements, run the complete
application lane:

```sh
(
  set -eu
  umask 077
  PG_APPLICATION_RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/oce-postgres-application.XXXXXX")"
  printf 'PostgreSQL run directory: %s\n' "$PG_APPLICATION_RUN_DIR"
  trap 'pg_run_status=$?; node scripts/ci/cleanup.mjs --state "$PG_APPLICATION_RUN_DIR/state.json" || pg_run_status=1; exit "$pg_run_status"' EXIT

  node scripts/ci/prepare.mjs --lane postgres-application \
    --state "$PG_APPLICATION_RUN_DIR/state.json" \
    --github-env "$PG_APPLICATION_RUN_DIR/owner.env"
  node scripts/ci/run-tests.mjs run postgres-application \
    --state "$PG_APPLICATION_RUN_DIR/state.json" \
    --results "$PG_APPLICATION_RUN_DIR/results.json"
)
```

For only the revision-worker file, use a fresh run directory:

```sh
(
  set -eu
  umask 077
  PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/oce-postgres-worker.XXXXXX")"
  printf 'PostgreSQL run directory: %s\n' "$PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR"
  trap 'pg_run_status=$?; node scripts/ci/cleanup.mjs --state "$PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR/state.json" || pg_run_status=1; exit "$pg_run_status"' EXIT

  node scripts/ci/prepare.mjs --lane postgres-application \
    --state "$PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR/state.json" \
    --github-env "$PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR/owner.env"
  node scripts/ci/prepare.mjs --lane postgres-application \
    --file tests/integration/postgres-worker-agent-revision.test.mjs \
    --state "$PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR/state.json" \
    --github-env "$PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR/test.env"
  env -u OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL -u OPENCLAW_ENTERPRISE_CI_STATE \
    -u OPENCLAW_ENTERPRISE_CI_PREFIX \
    node --env-file="$PG_WORKER_RUN_DIR/test.env" --test \
    tests/integration/postgres-worker-agent-revision.test.mjs
)
```

Each invocation needs its own state file; do not run two commands against the
same prepared state concurrently. The commands clean up that run's databases
and Compose server when they finish, including after a test failure. The
application lane writes its result JSON in the printed run directory. If the
shell is interrupted before cleanup completes, rerun
`node scripts/ci/cleanup.mjs --state /printed/run/directory/state.json`.
Retain failed-run output and result JSON while investigating.

## Other PostgreSQL suites

Requires Docker Compose. Use disposable databases: tests can initialize or
change singleton platform state. The production bootstrap database must be
migrated and contain no Installation.

The following creates three new databases: general tests, production bootstrap,
and Kubernetes. If any name already exists, choose a new test name and update
the corresponding URL; do not drop an existing database to make setup pass.

```sh
pnpm db:up

(
  set -eu
  for test_database in openclaw_test_local openclaw_bootstrap_local openclaw_k8s_local; do
    docker compose -f compose.postgres.yaml exec -T postgres \
      psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U postgres -d postgres \
      -c "CREATE DATABASE $test_database"
    docker compose -f compose.postgres.yaml exec -T postgres \
      psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -U postgres -d "$test_database" \
      -c "GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE $test_database TO occ_migrator; CREATE SCHEMA occ AUTHORIZATION occ_migrator; CREATE SCHEMA drizzle AUTHORIZATION occ_migrator; REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;"
    OCC_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://occ_migrator:occ-migrator-local@127.0.0.1:55432/$test_database" \
      pnpm db:migrate
  done
)
```

Compose provisions the local `occ_migrator` and `occ_app` roles. Run migrations
as `occ_migrator` and the tests as the less-privileged `occ_app`. Queue coverage
uses `OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL` with the other `pg.Pool`-backed PostgreSQL tests;
production bootstrap still needs its own URL:

```sh
(
  export OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://occ_app:occ-app-local@127.0.0.1:55432/openclaw_test_local
  export OCC_PRODUCTION_WIREUP_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://occ_app:occ-app-local@127.0.0.1:55432/openclaw_bootstrap_local
  node --test --test-concurrency=1 \
    tests/integration/postgres-platform-state.test.mjs \
    tests/integration/postgres-production-wireup.test.mjs \
    tests/integration/compute-singleton-worker-postgres.test.mjs
)
```

This example selects platform persistence, production bootstrap, and
singleton-worker coverage. Omitting the general URL skips most persistence and
queue cases; omitting `OCC_PRODUCTION_WIREUP_DATABASE_URL` skips production
bootstrap. Use the prepared `postgres-application` lane above for its complete
file selection. Broad `test:postgres`, `test:integration`, and `test` commands
include the revision-worker suite, which requires prepared ownership when
selected with a database URL.

The production bootstrap test also exercises existing-person Agent sharing through
real cookie-authenticated HTTP, native IAM and restricted PostgreSQL State. It
checks initial denial, exact Namespace/Agent grants, sibling and Configuration
denial, persisted sessions and policy after application restart, and selective
revocation while another person retains access. The fixture seeds an existing
Installation-reader Role; account creation and password sign-in use ordinary APIs.
This is not atomic-enrollment proof. Its passive Compute and test Configuration/Secret
Drivers do not establish native Gateway execution or closure of open streams.

Four optional live Configuration cases additionally require
`OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_CONFIGURATION=1` and an already configured live Kubernetes
Configuration Driver in the subprocess startup environment. The flag alone
does not configure that Driver. A pre-bootstrap case also skips if its database
already has an Installation. See [PostgreSQL settings](#postgresql-test-environment).

For a repeat of production bootstrap, prepare a fresh migrated database and
change its URL. Keep the general and bootstrap databases separate.

## GitHub human sign-in

`tests/integration/postgres-github-sign-in.test.mjs` exercises ordinary PostgreSQL
development composition, real controller routes across a stopped maintenance restart,
and a Playwright browser using the Console. It selects the application-role
`OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL`; use a fresh disposable database prepared by the migrator.
The test provisions its own Installation and local recovery administrator.
Select an already prepared browser with `OCC_TEST_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` when needed:

```sh
node --test tests/integration/postgres-github-sign-in.test.mjs
```

The suite checks existing-account enrollment, unchanged Principals and grants,
the one-use attempt receipt exchange and `x-occ-session-key` narrowing, password parity, rejection of older unbound sessions, one-use callback handling,
account-wide revocation, protected recovery, and browser access to an already
permitted Namespace and existing Agent detail. It checks actual listener stop, admitted-request drain, activation and restart in the loopback composition; installed ingress and deployment controls remain a separate qualification. Provider exchange/profile HTTP responses are controlled
fixtures. They allow deterministic optional-email and rejected-identity cases;
they do not establish live GitHub registration, provider availability, or deployed
HTTPS cookie behavior. Missing database configuration skips the case; a missing
browser fails it. A command invocation or green memory-backed suite does not
establish that this PostgreSQL/browser proof ran successfully.

The same PostgreSQL lane also runs
`tests/integration/postgres-human-authentication.test.mjs` for the original State
transaction, account/method currentness, recovery protections, and concurrent
issuance/revocation, actor-session revocation races, account-version conflicts,
attachment invalidation, State deadlines and persisted attempt bounds.
`tests/integration/postgres-github-cookie-commit.test.mjs` checks audit rollback
and lost COMMIT acknowledgements through the controller. It drops a real
PostgreSQL COMMIT response through the loopback protocol proxy and verifies
persisted state, withheld cookies, and no replay. It also checks the ordinary
HTTP cookie boundary for login and logout, unknown administrative completion,
and a guarded present-state read. Password sign-in runs without a browser
Origin header; a headerless sign-out is rejected with `403` and leaves the
session current, and the other sign-outs send the configured Origin. No live
provider credential
is needed for these cases. Hosted PostgreSQL CI prepares Chromium after the
frozen workspace dependencies; local runs use the prepared browser above.

## Password-default sign-in

GitHub sign-in is optional; these suites prove the default. Each needs a fresh
`OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL` and composes the production API from the settings the
example Helm values render, after the real production bootstrap:

- `postgres-password-default.test.mjs`: GitHub unconfigured. Administrator
  onboarding, account creation, Origin-checked sign-out, refused GitHub routes,
  and wrong passwords that never lock the administrator out.
- `postgres-password-default-activation.test.mjs`: the GitHub upgrade enrols
  earlier password accounts, logs skipped ones, and keeps account creation.
- `postgres-github-outage.test.mjs`: a fixture provider that errors, then stalls
  past the ten-second deadline. GitHub sign-in fails closed, passwords keep
  working, and the recovery administrator signs in while the shared lane is full.

The same composition covers the GitHub profile against the fixture provider:

- `postgres-github-admin-attach.test.mjs`: administrators attach, detach and
  re-attach GitHub identities, and disable and enable accounts. A session without
  Installation `administer` gets `403` on every account and recovery route, and two
  administrators attaching one GitHub identity at once get one `200` and one `409`.
- `postgres-github-admin-scope.test.mjs`: a created administrator cannot attach
  an identity to, or revoke, the broader bootstrap administrator's account, or
  take its recovery designation.
- `postgres-github-tab-binding.test.mjs`, `postgres-oidc-tab-binding.test.mjs`:
  Playwright over the HTTPS Origin. A tab signed in with GitHub, or OIDC alone, signs
  out after another tab's password sign-in; the login receipt is one-use and needs the
  exact Origin.
- `postgres-github-recovery-replacement.test.mjs`: online recovery replacement
  moves the reserved password lane and survives a restart with the original seed.
- `postgres-google-sign-in.test.mjs`: Google sign-in against a fixture OpenID
  Connect provider (`fakeGoogle` in `tests/helpers/production-sign-in.mjs`) that
  signs RS256 ID tokens with a local key. It covers attached-only admission, bad
  ID-token claims, state and binding-cookie replay, password fallback, detach,
  disablement, and GitHub plus Google together. No real Google client is used;
  `google-id-token` and `google-login-transport` cover the verifier and transport.
- `postgres-break-glass-auth-maintain.test.mjs`: also needs
  `OCC_AUTH_MAINTAIN_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`. With the API stopped,
  `auth:maintain` resets the recovery password and deactivates GitHub sign-in.

`tests/integration/sign-in-chart-parity.test.mjs` (Images and Packaging lane, Helm and yq) checks
that the chart renders exactly those settings, and that the API entrypoint
accepts the rendered settings for every trusted-proxy preset, with and without
GitHub, and refuses what the chart refuses. Accepted settings get as far as the
PostgreSQL connection, which the suite points at an unreachable address, so it
does not prove that the API starts with every preset. The PostgreSQL scenarios
above start the API with their own settings.

## Authentication maintenance

`tests/integration/auth-maintain.test.mjs` runs the real `scripts/auth-maintain.mjs`
command against a fresh database: `OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL` as `occ_app` and
`OCC_AUTH_MAINTAIN_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` as `occ_migrator` for the same database.
It covers activation, the refusal while another client is connected, enrolment
repair, recovery password reset, session purge, and deactivation back to the
legacy profile, including the disabled-account refusal. The suite closes its own
connections before each command; any other client on the database makes the
commands exit 2. It does not exercise a Kubernetes Job or a scaled-down API.

## Canonical migration compatibility

The mandatory native `postgres` lane runs
`tests/integration/postgres-migration-compatibility.test.mjs` against its
recorded fixture. Its canonical-history cases create new owned databases,
install historical prefixes with stock Drizzle, and invoke the real development
and production migration commands. They cover fresh and populated-main
installation, unchanged receipts/data, repeat/concurrent runners, transaction
rollback/retry, unsupported-history and initial-ACL refusal, added empty default
ACLs on installed histories, and the actual `occ_app` temporary-domain attack
against inherited privileged functions.

For an already-owned loopback PostgreSQL 18 fixture with the repository's local
test roles, explicitly select the running container, its mapped port, and a
unique database prefix. The suite validates the mapping, creates only new names
under that prefix, and drops only databases it created:

```sh
OCC_MIGRATION_HISTORY_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://occ_migrator:occ-migrator-local@127.0.0.1:$TEST_POSTGRES_PORT/postgres" \
OCC_MIGRATION_HISTORY_CONTAINER="$TEST_POSTGRES_CONTAINER" \
OCC_MIGRATION_HISTORY_DATABASE_PREFIX=openclaw_migration_test_local \
  node --test --test-name-pattern=Canonical tests/integration/postgres-migration-compatibility.test.mjs
```

The database prefix must start with `openclaw_`, contain only lowercase letters,
digits, and underscores, and have at most 50 characters. All three selectors
are required together. This mode reuses the selected server and roles; it does
not provision or repair them. The database-local administrator fixture uses
`docker exec` for database creation, failure injection, and cleanup. Preserve
the command output when a case fails. These tests prove SQL and entrypoint
behavior, not installed State/API, Agent deletion, credential custody, or live
provider operation. Developer recovery is documented under
[migration history](../reference/settings/operations.md#migration-history).

## PostgreSQL test environment

| Variable                                       | Required by                                | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL`                        | Real PostgreSQL integration tests.         | Must use an initialized application-role database. Skipped when absent; [revision-worker tests](#revision-worker-tests) additionally require prepared ownership.                           |
| `OCC_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`                   | `db:migrate` setup before tests.           | Uses the separate migrator role for schema and migration-history ownership; the test process should use application-role URLs.                                                             |
| `OCC_PRODUCTION_WIREUP_DATABASE_URL`           | Production bootstrap integration.          | Uses a separately migrated, disposable, initially empty application-role database; the production bootstrap skips when absent.                                                             |
| `OCC_BOOTSTRAP_FAILURE_DATABASE_URL`           | Bootstrap race and uncertain-commit tests. | Application-role URL for a migrated, disposable loopback database named `openclaw_failures_*`. The suite resets its tables; skipped when absent.                                           |
| `OCC_BOOTSTRAP_FAILURE_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` | Bootstrap failure fixture setup/reset.     | Optional for the local `occ_app` fixture, which uses `occ_migrator` and its local test password; otherwise required. Must target the same host, port, and database as the application URL. |
| `OCC_AUTH_MAINTAIN_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`     | Authentication maintenance integration.    | Migrator-role URL for the same fresh database as `OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL`; the case is skipped when absent.                                                                                 |
| `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_CONFIGURATION`            | Optional live Configuration coverage.      | Set to `1` only when the PostgreSQL integration also has an explicitly configured live Kubernetes Configuration Driver.                                                                    |

The bootstrap integration creates its own exact Installation and administrators;
do not rerun it against a previous bootstrap database or point it at an
existing development Installation. Use a dedicated disposable database for any
other case when existing local platform state must be preserved.

The [bootstrap failure suite](../../tests/integration/postgres-bootstrap-failures.test.mjs)
requires a separate migrated `openclaw_failures_*` database on loopback. Its
migration-role fixture installs a temporary delay trigger and resets tables
between cases; run it without any other process using that database. Both
initializer modes run with the application role.
After preparing that disposable database using the existing PostgreSQL setup:

```bash
OCC_BOOTSTRAP_FAILURE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://occ_app:occ-app-local@127.0.0.1:55432/openclaw_failures_local \
  node --test tests/integration/postgres-bootstrap-failures.test.mjs
```

## Azure workload-identity connections

Select the `postgres-azure-workload-identity` lane to run
[postgres-azure-workload-identity.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/postgres-azure-workload-identity.test.mjs)
against an existing authorized Azure PostgreSQL database. This lane has no
GitHub workflow entrypoint and provisions no database or identity resources.
The ordinary constructor, security-rejection, real password-authentication,
and terminated-idle-connection cases remain in
[postgres-connection-auth.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/postgres-connection-auth.test.mjs),
owned by the mandatory `postgres` lane.

Prepare a private environment file outside the repository with all four inputs:

| Variable                      | Required value                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OCC_TEST_AZURE_DATABASE_URL` | Password-free application-role URL using verified TLS, such as `postgresql://occ_app@database.example/occ?sslmode=verify-full`. |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID`             | Tenant for the selected workload identity.                                                                                      |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`             | Client ID for the selected workload identity with database access.                                                              |
| `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`  | Readable projected federation-token file for that identity.                                                                     |

Follow the [connection authentication contract](../reference/settings/operations.md#postgresql-connection-authentication)
for TLS and identity requirements. Keep these inputs scoped to the selected
test process; the test selects Azure authentication explicitly. Then run:

```sh
umask 077
TEST_ENV_FILE=/absolute/path/to/private/postgres-azure-test.env
chmod 600 "$TEST_ENV_FILE"
POSTGRES_AZURE_RESULTS_DIRECTORY="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/oce-postgres-azure.XXXXXX")"
node --env-file="$TEST_ENV_FILE" scripts/ci/run-tests.mjs run postgres-azure-workload-identity \
  --state "$POSTGRES_AZURE_RESULTS_DIRECTORY/state.json" \
  --results "$POSTGRES_AZURE_RESULTS_DIRECTORY/results.json"
```

The fresh state path needs no preparation command for this lane. Missing
required inputs fail the selected lane, as do failed, skipped, or missing test
results. Broad direct test runs skip the Azure case when its URL is absent.
Retain the result JSON for the connection evidence, then remove only this run's
temporary result directory when it is no longer needed.

The read-only test opens two fresh, immediate connections through the shared
pool and checks that each returns an authenticated username and reports TLS in
`pg_stat_ssl`. It does not wait for token expiry or prove token rotation,
outage recovery, or an Azure deployment. For connection failures, check the
projected token file, federation configuration, database grants, and verified
TLS endpoint without printing credentials or tokens.

## Service-key persistence

`tests/integration/postgres-service-api-keys.test.mjs` covers stored hashing,
foreign-Installation rejection, cross-instance revocation, and deletion during
concurrent verification. These checks complement the
[local HTTP authorization tests](local.md#authentication-and-authorization-coverage);
neither suite verifies a deployed installation.

## Transaction outcome protocol

The PostgreSQL owner retains client transport errors through release and discards
failed connections. Lost COMMIT acknowledgments report
`PostgresCommitOutcomeUnknownError`; callers must inspect retained state before
retrying an effect. A socket failure does not prove rollback.

`tests/conformance/postgres-transaction-commit.test.mjs` exercises the actual outer
transaction owner with a transport protocol fixture. It covers definite server
rejection, ambiguous SQLSTATEs, exact COMMIT/ROLLBACK command acknowledgment,
and cleanup errors. A deadlock (`40P01`) or serialization failure (`40001`) is a
definite rollback and maps to retryable `DependencyUnavailableError` (`503`).
The fixture supplies no database or persistence proof.
Unknown acknowledgment always remains possibly committed, even when a later
ROLLBACK responds. An independent exact readback is required before reconciliation.

The COMMIT fault fixture follows the installed PostgreSQL driver's effective
host and port, including URL query overrides, and routes the test connection
through its loopback proxy. It rejects nonloopback targets and TLS connections
before mutation: inspecting encrypted protocol completion is unsupported, and
TLS intent is never silently downgraded. Use the ordinary disposable non-TLS
loopback setup above for this test.

## Authentication binding

With matching dependencies, check construction, public type contracts, and sanitized failures:

```sh
node --test tests/conformance/postgres-auth-binding.test.mjs tests/conformance/postgres-controller-auth-binding.test.mjs tests/conformance/schema-auth-boundary-v1.test.mjs
```

These checks do not prove SQL persistence. `pnpm typecheck` checks Controller composition.
With a migrated disposable database and `OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL` (setup above), run:

```sh
node --test --test-concurrency=1 tests/integration/postgres-auth-binding.test.mjs tests/integration/postgres-auth-accounts.test.mjs tests/integration/postgres-service-api-keys.test.mjs
```

These cover isolation, rollback, pool reuse, account provisioning, and service-key
persistence. Fresh bootstrap requires no Installation; missing database
configuration explicitly skips PostgreSQL coverage.

Construction errors require checking OCC/Drizzle dependencies. Later dependency
errors require checking connectivity and application-role permissions; successful
construction does not establish connectivity. See the
[binding reference](../reference/postgres-auth-binding.md) for ownership and transaction boundaries.
