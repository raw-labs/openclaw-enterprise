# Kubernetes tests

Prepare [shared prerequisites](README.md#requirements-and-credentials) for
Kubernetes HTTP fixtures or real-runtime gateway, Codex, model, and Secret tests.

## Local Kubernetes installation

Build the CLI and run the selected real test to create and clean up a separate
k3d cluster:

```sh
pnpm cli:build
OCC_TEST_DEV_UP_K3D_REAL=1 node --test tests/integration/dev-up-k3d-real.test.mjs
```

The Kubernetes-only case checks authenticated readiness, presets, plugin discovery,
and a dedicated Codex Agent’s sandbox using a synthetic credential. The Compose
case checks the launcher’s generated image and seccomp profile in a real Pod. Both
verify workspace writes succeed and outside writes fail; neither proves model
execution. The Compose case does not prove Agent routing. Failed cleanup preserves
state for `occ dev down`.

See [two-cluster validation](two-cluster-local.md).

## Kubernetes HTTP fixture

Requires Docker, k3d, `kubectl`, and the migrated `openclaw_k8s_local` database
from [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md#postgresql). Create a new disposable cluster; if `oce` already
exists, use a new name consistently throughout these commands.

```sh
mkdir -m 700 -p /tmp/oce-k3d
k3d cluster create oce \
  --image +v1.35 \
  --api-port 127.0.0.1:6443 \
  --kubeconfig-update-default=false \
  --kubeconfig-switch-context=false
k3d kubeconfig get oce > /tmp/oce-k3d/kubeconfig
chmod 600 /tmp/oce-k3d/kubeconfig

docker build --pull=false -t oce-fixture:local tests/fixtures/kubernetes
k3d image import oce-fixture:local -c oce

OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_KUBECONFIG=/tmp/oce-k3d/kubeconfig \
OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_CONTEXT=k3d-oce \
OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_IMAGE=oce-fixture:local \
OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://occ_app:occ-app-local@127.0.0.1:55432/openclaw_k8s_local \
  node --test tests/integration/kubernetes-compute-real.test.mjs
```

All four fixture cases must run: Driver lifecycle/isolation, externally managed
namespace preservation, provisioning handoff, and PostgreSQL API-plus-worker
reconciliation. No model
key is needed. Missing all cluster selectors skips the suite; partial selectors
fail, and a missing database skips the API-plus-worker case.

Set `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_RUNTIME_IMAGE` to an imported immutable runtime image
reference to extend the API-plus-worker case through real runtime credential
Secret and private-state claim deletion. The case uses nonfunctional fixture
credentials and performs no model turn.

The tests require an explicit loopback `k3d-*` context and enforcing
NetworkPolicies. They create scoped RBAC and resources and use the stock
local-path provisioner for RWO Harness workspaces. The API-plus-worker case
verifies that replacement retains the PVC UID and a file written by the old
Harness. The HTTP fixture can fail native readiness using a workspace marker;
a later deployment must retain both earlier files and writes from the failed
candidate. This proves serial replacement on local storage, not cloud CSI detach,
node fencing, or data movement between nodes. Use a disposable cluster.

### Fixture images and security controls

The nonroot `tests/fixtures/kubernetes` image uses generated Namespace labels,
ResourceQuota, LimitRange, NetworkPolicies, and container security settings.
The suite verifies tenant isolation, resource bounds, seccomp, dropped
capabilities, and a read-only root filesystem. Its mutable tag and unpinned
`docker.io/library/node:24-bookworm-slim` base are fixture-only; production images
require pinning and review.

API-plus-worker Secrets are synthetic; channel runtime needs the images and
credentials below. Removing, emptying, or changing a cloned workload Pod's network
profile must deny DNS between successful controls.

The API-plus-worker case checks UDP/TCP 5353 DNS from embedded Agents, dedicated
Harnesses, and Gateways. An unselected CoreDNS peer and port 5354 are denied
between successful controls; an unrestricted Pod verifies listener availability.
Readiness gates exclude fixtures from cluster DNS endpoints. This proves k3d
enforcement, not OpenShift.

Live Configuration ConfigMap CRUD and least-privilege RBAC cases require the
selected disposable cluster and tenant credentials. Without those inputs, they
skip explicitly. Schema, controller, and SDK fixtures do not exercise that live
cluster behavior.

The plugin-status fixture tests wait for Driver readiness, a ready gateway Pod,
and its plugin status before asserting startup or restart results. A later Pod
status read does not establish that an earlier Driver observation was ready.
CI preparation first waits up to 120 seconds for the server's route to the worker
Pod CIDR to use `flannel.1`, then admits that route's source `/32` for API-server
Pod proxy requests. Node readiness alone can precede this route; selecting the
container network's default-route source would leave ready Pods unreachable
through the proxy. An absent overlay route fails preparation before it publishes
the test environment.

## Kubernetes model turns and Secrets

Follow [Codex sandbox setup](../guides/deploy/codex-sandbox.md) for seccomp
prerequisites. CI checks workspace writes and outside-write denial; the native
workspace case additionally requires tool-history evidence with `approvalPolicy: never`.
Credentialed repository access requires separate proof.

### Develop with local containers and k3d

The helper prepares disposable k3d, isolated PostgreSQL, and gateway/Codex images.
Start Docker or Podman's API socket (Podman Machine on macOS), then run:

```sh
export OCC_TEST_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-6-astra
./scripts/k3d
```

When `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not already set, the interactive `demo` command prompts
for it without echoing the value. `test` requires the variable explicitly;
`reset` does not require it. A prompted value exists only in the helper process
and its children; the helper never writes it to state files.

The helper requires k3d, `kubectl`, Helm, OpenSSL, and Docker Compose or
`podman-compose`. It prefers a running Podman API socket unless `DOCKER_HOST`
selects an engine. Set `OCC_K3D_CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman` or `docker` to override detection.

Preparation state is private to the selected engine under
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/openclaw-enterprise/k3d-<engine>-codex`.
Set `OCC_K3D_STATE_DIR` to an absolute path to override that location. Later
runs reuse the prepared cluster, database, images, Envoy Gateway, cert-manager,
and the disposable private-routing CA. This helper has no image upgrade command;
its demo resources are disposable. For a separate persistent Helm installation,
see [local k3d image upgrades](../guides/deploy/local-k3d-image-upgrade.md). The helper builds the current checkout
and ignores Kubernetes image selectors inherited from an earlier test shell.
Run `./scripts/k3d down` before reusing state prepared without workspace routing.

To clear an interrupted test or rerun against a fresh database while preserving
the PostgreSQL service, cluster, and imported images:

```sh
./scripts/k3d reset
```

Reset deletes only helper test Namespaces, such as `oce-production-*`,
`oce-openshell-*`, and `oce-ns-*`, from the helper-owned cluster. It drops and
recreates only the database recorded in the helper's private state.

The default command starts the OCC API in Kubernetes, creates a dedicated Codex
Agent, and completes a model turn. It serves the OpenClaw Control UI at
`http://127.0.0.1:18888` and the OCC console at `http://127.0.0.1:18889`.
The command prints the temporary OCC username and a command to copy its password
from the mode-`0600` `demo.json` file, without printing passwords.

Pass `--harness openclaw` for the verification-only
[native OpenClaw Harness](openshell.md#native-openclaw-with-k3d).

The development login is `admin@openclaw.local` with
`openclaw-development-password`. Override it with `OPENCLAW_DEV_EMAIL` or
`OPENCLAW_DEV_PASSWORD`; the database retains the account, so reset before
restarting the demo after changing its password. Use `./scripts/k3d get
openclaw-control-ui` for the Control UI URL and `./scripts/k3d copy
openclaw-password` for its **Gateway secret**. This separate password preserves
direct loopback access while OCC workspace files use trusted-proxy authentication.

Keep the command running while using either interface. Ctrl-C stops the local
controller and worker, closes port-forwards, and removes the private state file
and demo Namespaces. The prepared cluster, images, routing controllers, and
PostgreSQL remain; rerun `./scripts/k3d` to recreate demo resources.

Inspect the current demo and cluster details without parsing the private state
files directly:

```sh
./scripts/k3d info
./scripts/k3d copy openclaw-password
./scripts/k3d copy occ-password
```

`info` reports the engine, state directory, status, connection values, password
copy commands, and host/container processes. `get` prints a selected non-sensitive
value; run `./scripts/k3d help` for fields. `copy` sends either password to the
clipboard with `pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, or `xclip`, never to standard output. The OCC console's Workspace files panel uses
the same private Envoy route exercised by the focused gateway-routing
integration. Demo fields become available after the foreground command reports
readiness. Cluster fields remain available while its prepared state exists.

To run the dedicated Codex gateway-routing integration instead:

```sh
./scripts/k3d test
```

The test proves model turns, OCC workspace access through Envoy, routing
credential enforcement and rotation, certificate renewal, Pod replacement, and
workspace retention. It does not cover credential recovery or embedded OpenClaw.

Remove only resources recorded in the helper's owned state when finished:

```sh
./scripts/k3d down
```

If preparation fails, run the same cleanup command before retrying. The helper
does not use or modify the default kubeconfig, active context, the development
database on port 55432, or unrelated container-engine resources.

Use the disposable cluster and `openclaw_k8s_*` database above, an exported
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, and approved real gateway/Codex images. Import local image
tags, then register their corresponding immutable references inside k3s.
Replace the placeholders with the exact tags and digest references for your
images:

```sh
k3d image import '<local-gateway-tag>' '<local-codex-tag>' -c oce
docker exec k3d-oce-server-0 ctr -n k8s.io images tag \
  '<imported-gateway-image>' '<gateway-image>@sha256:<digest>'
docker exec k3d-oce-server-0 ctr -n k8s.io images tag \
  '<imported-codex-image>' '<codex-image>@sha256:<digest>'
```

Prepare a private runtime environment file with the model key and these
nonsecret settings, using the actual digest references:

```dotenv
OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_KUBECONFIG=/tmp/oce-k3d/kubeconfig
OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_CONTEXT=k3d-oce
OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://occ_app:occ-app-local@127.0.0.1:55432/openclaw_k8s_local
OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_GATEWAY_IMAGE=<gateway-image>@sha256:<digest>
OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_AGENT_IMAGE=<codex-image>@sha256:<digest>
OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_PLUGIN_STATUS_PROXY_CIDRS=<api-server-proxy-source>/32
OCC_TEST_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-6-astra
```

The startup failure cases use dedicated Codex with plugins enabled and disabled.
They assert the saved failure through deployment GET after failed Pod deletion
and controller restart. This proves retained startup evidence, not live health.
Set the private status proxy CIDRs to the actual API-server Pod-proxy source;
CI preparation supplies them. For manual clusters, follow the
[networking setup](../reference/drivers/kubernetes-compute/networking-and-isolation.md#networking).

Private workspace-file routing has a separate [gateway-routing suite](gateway-routing.md) with additional Envoy Gateway, cert-manager, and test-CA setup.

Run the ordinary runtime cases independently of Slack:

```sh
OCC_TEST_HARNESS_K3D_REAL=1 OCC_TEST_SLACK_LIVE=0 \
  node --env-file="$TEST_ENV_FILE" --test tests/integration/harness-topology-k3d-real.test.mjs
```

Non-Slack cases cover dedicated Codex, embedded OpenClaw, and Secret lifecycle.
Both topologies use OCC Secret-backed Agent `harnessAuth` bindings. The Secret API
case covers native SecretRefs, grants, denial, sharing, rotation, and redeployment.

The ordinary suite runs the production API and worker in Node. Gateway-routing
deploys the API in Kubernetes for normal Envoy-to-Service routing; its worker
and coordinator run in Node. Neither installs the controller with Helm.
Selected suites fail on missing prerequisites; unselected suites skip.
Codex defaults to `0.158.0`; see [runtime settings](#kubernetes-real-runtime-test-environment)
for version assertions and alternate images.

### Candidate Skill source lifecycle

Use candidate images supporting paired-node Skill uploads and local `zip`:

```sh
OCC_TEST_SKILL_SOURCE_LIFECYCLE=1 node --env-file="$TEST_ENV_FILE" --test \
  --test-name-pattern='candidate dedicated Skill source' \
  tests/integration/harness-topology-k3d-real.test.mjs
```

Verifies source replacement, denied writes preserving bytes/lockfiles, and recovery
through OCC redeploy. No conversation turn; unsupported runtime images fail.

### Transcript persistence

Both Harness topologies require SQLite transcripts. Persistence cases query
`session_nodes` and `transcript_events`, then verify conversation history and media
after gateway Pod replacement. Images with JSONL transcripts cannot exercise
this path, even with SQLite authentication or memory.
`OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_OPENCLAW_VERSION` alone does not verify transcript storage.

For Secret changes, run the API and PostgreSQL suites as well as the real
Kubernetes runtime cases. Route/schema checks and documentation checks alone do
not verify Kubernetes Secret storage and delivery. These suites exercise the
selected disposable resources; deployments need their own runtime verification.

## Kubernetes fixture test environment

Real-cluster integration is opt-in for ordinary development and required when
explicitly requested or validating the production-capable Kubernetes driver for
release. The test harness requires a dedicated
loopback-only k3d context. The driver itself also supports verified
remote HTTPS API servers and in-cluster ServiceAccount authentication. These
variables do not configure `server.mjs`, `worker.mjs`, the normal controller, or
its default Compute Driver.

CI selects the Kubernetes 1.35 family so the fixture proves the supported
minimum line; a manually selected server must be 1.35 or later. The test
exercises the real version endpoint through its scoped controller identity
before creating tenant resources.

| Variable                            | Requirement                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_KUBECONFIG`    | Absolute path to the dedicated disposable local-cluster kubeconfig.                                |
| `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_CONTEXT`       | Explicit context whose HTTPS API server is loopback-only with an explicit port.                    |
| `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_IMAGE`         | Locally available fixture image already imported into the selected cluster.                        |
| `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_RUNTIME_IMAGE` | Optional immutable runtime image for credential Secret and private-state teardown proof.           |
| `OCC_TEST_DATABASE_URL`             | Required for API-and-worker coverage; must select a dedicated, migrated `openclaw_k8s_*` database. |

The [HTTP fixture procedure](#kubernetes-http-fixture) covers setup and
PostgreSQL-backed testing; the API-and-worker case rejects the ordinary
`openclaw_enterprise` database. The fixture does not prove a real gateway,
authenticated Codex connection, or model turn; use the
[real-runtime suite](#kubernetes-model-turns-and-secrets) for model-turn proof.

CI keeps the project-pinned k3d 5.8.3 binary and passes a digest-pinned K3s
1.35 node image (`defaultK3sImage` in `scripts/ci/prepare.mjs`) when it creates
ordinary disposable clusters, so creation never depends on k3d's online
release-channel lookup. Moving to a newer 1.35.z patch is a deliberate bump of
that constant. Preparation rejects a server outside the 1.35 family. The CI
`kubectl` client is pinned to 1.35.0. The separately prepared OpenShell lane
retains its own pinned K3s and `kubectl` versions.

## Kubernetes real-runtime test environment

[`harness-topology-k3d-real.test.mjs`](../../tests/integration/harness-topology-k3d-real.test.mjs)
is independently opt-in. Set `OCC_TEST_HARNESS_K3D_REAL=1` or explicitly select
a real runtime image to enable the ordinary runtime suite. Once selected,
missing cluster, image, database, credential, or NetworkPolicy prerequisites
fail instead of skipping. The ordinary suite verifies dedicated Codex, embedded
OpenClaw with a persisted provider credential, and embedded OpenClaw with the
Secret API through real Enterprise gateways on an explicitly selected disposable
k3d cluster. It does not prove Agent workspace-file private routing until
Compute HTTPRoutes, real Envoy Gateway, cert-manager, OCC, and the native Agent
runtime are tested together. The default is `gpt-6-astra`; for dedicated Codex
coverage, any `OCC_TEST_OPENAI_MODEL` override must be authorized and support
Codex custom tools.

The separate [`harness-topology-k3d-routing-real.test.mjs`](../../tests/integration/harness-topology-k3d-routing-real.test.mjs) requires
`OCC_TEST_GATEWAY_ROUTING_REAL=1` and the same runtime prerequisites. It also
requires ready Envoy Gateway and cert-manager controllers,
`OCC_TEST_GATEWAY_CA_CERT_PATH`, `OCC_TEST_GATEWAY_CA_KEY_PATH`,
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, and an imported `OCC_TEST_PRODUCTION_CONTROLLER_IMAGE`.
The suite starts the OCC API in Kubernetes and uses the Envoy ClusterIP Service
on its standard HTTPS port; no host Envoy port is published.
Controller namespace overrides are `OCC_TEST_ENVOY_GATEWAY_NAMESPACE` (default
`envoy-gateway-system`) and `OCC_TEST_CERT_MANAGER_NAMESPACE` (default
`cert-manager`). See the
[focused routing proof](gateway-routing.md#setup-and-execution) for
the disposable CA and command. The CA private key is test setup only; the
production OCC API mounts only a public trust bundle.

## Dedicated Gateway placement

Dedicated Gateway resources now live in the logical Namespace's managed Gateway
runtime namespace. Fixture bootstrap must grant the worker scoped access there
as well as in the Harness namespace before waiting for Namespace readiness.
Runtime helper results expose `gatewayPlacement` separately from `placement`.
Use the former for Gateway Pods, routes, private PVCs and port-forwards; use the
latter for Harness execution, model credentials and workspace storage.

Disposable runtime helpers accept `OCC_TEST_KUBERNETES_GATEWAY_NODE_SELECTOR` as
a JSON selector and default to Linux nodes. The default tests namespace and
credential separation; it does not prove production node-pool isolation. Configure
separate reviewed node pools for that proof. Current tests must still pass with
the actual supported Gateway/Codex images and authenticated node reconnect;
fixture readiness is not a substitute for model-backed acceptance.

## Production observability
