# Private gateway routing tests

Use the local k3d launcher or the CI `gateway-routing` lane to prepare this
suite. Both paths add Envoy Gateway and cert-manager to an owned disposable
cluster.

## Setup and execution

Workspace-file conformance and Helm rendering are separate from the real
private-routing proof. The focused case requires Envoy Gateway v1.6.7 and
cert-manager controllers/CRDs in the selected disposable cluster, in addition
to the database, native gateway/Codex images, and authorized model credential.
It must use the real Envoy data plane; a hand-built TLS proxy does not exercise
the supported routing or authentication implementation.

The focused proof runs the production OCC API as a Kubernetes Deployment,
creates an Agent through production OCC composition, waits for Compute's
automatic HTTPRoute, writes and reads all four supported files,
and asks a fresh native session for the marker supplied only through
`AGENTS.md`. It then replaces the gateway Pod and repeats file reads and fresh
model consumption. Proxy authentication denials, key rotation, and cert-manager
leaf renewal under the same CA are separate required assertions.

The same case exercises Compute's dedicated `/node` route with the published
Gateway client and a temporary Ed25519 identity. It issues a node-only setup
code through the administrative route, pairs and reconnects without the Envoy
API key, rejects forged administrative headers and operator-role escalation,
then stops the Agent through OCC and waits for both routes and the node policy
to disappear. This verifies routing and native protocol authentication, not
the Harness's node process, credential persistence, CA delivery or egress.
The node-route assertions remain pending until this real Envoy case runs;
conformance and rendered resources do not prove policy override behavior.

The pinned Envoy Gateway v1.6.7
[SecurityPolicy translator](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/blob/v1.6.7/internal/gatewayapi/securitypolicy.go)
applies route policies before Gateway policies and skips an already configured
route. A route policy containing only `targetRefs` therefore replaces inherited
API-key authentication; it does not merge with the Gateway policy.

For CI-shaped setup, let `prepare.mjs` install the pinned Gateway API,
cert-manager v1.18.4, and Envoy Gateway v1.6.7 controllers, then create the
disposable test CA before `run-tests.mjs` invokes the case:

```sh
node scripts/ci/prepare.mjs \
  --lane gateway-routing \
  --state "$RUNNER_TEMP/state/gateway-routing.json" \
  --github-env "$GITHUB_ENV"
node scripts/ci/run-tests.mjs run gateway-routing \
  --state "$RUNNER_TEMP/state/gateway-routing.json" \
  --results "$RUNNER_TEMP/results/gateway-routing.json"
```

For local execution, provide an authorized `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment
and run:

```sh
./scripts/k3d test
```

The launcher prepares the current controller and runtime images, owned k3d
cluster, isolated PostgreSQL database, controllers, and disposable CA before it
runs the focused case. Run `./scripts/k3d down` to remove those resources.

The k3d preparation keeps the Gateway API CRDs bundled with k3s and removes the
duplicate `gateway.networking.k8s.io` CRDs from Envoy Gateway's installation
manifest before applying its controller and Envoy-specific CRDs. This preserves
k3s storage-version ownership instead of attempting an unsafe CRD downgrade.

The focused fixture requires a supported local container engine. Preparation
builds and imports the current controller image, then the fixture runs the
production OCC API and worker inside the disposable cluster with separate
ServiceAccounts. Both use Compute's
standard Envoy Service DNS URL and HTTPS port; no test-only endpoint port or
host publisher is involved. A loopback port-forward exposes only the API to the
local OCC console and test coordinator. The coordinator reads real worker logs
for lifecycle assertions. The fixture does not install the full controller Helm
release. The test applies the
chart's Gateway policies, rotates the listener key and API-side projected key,
and verifies certificate renewal without restarting OCC.

The ordinary [native-runtime suite](kubernetes.md#kubernetes-model-turns-and-secrets) leaves this additional routing case unselected. The earlier Docker manual-proxy proof has been removed because
Docker does not implement automatic private Agent routes.

## Native Gateway sharing

Prepare `gateway-routing`, then run `native-admin-k3d-real.test.mjs`. Its embedded sharing case checks
human cookies, exact Agent grants, denied sibling/Configuration access, the
Console launcher and installed model turns. The native-browser case creates an assignment before role deployment, changes it after stop reconciliation clears the active revision, and verifies access after redeployment. Removing one binding must close that
person's WebSockets within 30 seconds while another continues.
This does not qualify account enrollment, per-chat authority, Git or OpenShell.
