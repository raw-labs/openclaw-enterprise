# Integration tests outside automatic CI

These integration files have no automatic workflow entrypoint.
A green `CI Required` check does not establish their coverage. This inventory describes workflow selection, not
local or hosted test results.

## Choose the matrix or a focused lane

Start with the [QA matrix scenario inventory](qa-matrix.md#coverage-and-applicability)
for the four shipped installation/preset combinations. Read its
[scenario outcomes](qa-matrix.md#read-scenario-outcomes) to distinguish passed,
failed, blocked, and unexecuted coverage.

The matrix overlaps ordinary deployment and model checks in `k3d-model`, but
that lane also tests Pod-replacement continuity, secret rotation and rejection,
durable startup failures, and first-Agent reuse. Keep those distinct assertions
when consolidating setup. A model call before and after replacement proves a
transition that a startup-only call cannot.

Both matrix installation modes use Kubernetes compute. `docker-model` exercises
Docker Compute instead. Other focused lanes retain routing, sandbox, provider
provisioning, telemetry, and failure-boundary checks outside the matrix. These
manual lanes do not run as part of automatic `CI Required`.

## Manual Full Integration lanes

These files run only when selected in
[Full Integration](../../.github/workflows/full-integration.yml), using the listed
lane or `all` (`all` excludes `qa-matrix` until its environment exists).
Model/service lanes require configured credentials and infrastructure.
`helper-timeout` is separate because it spends five minutes testing the helper deadline.

## No GitHub workflow entrypoint

[dev-up-k3d-real.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/dev-up-k3d-real.test.mjs)
belongs to the CLI-only `dev-up-k3d` lane, outside both workflow groups and
Full Integration dispatch. See [run the local installation lane](README.md#run-the-local-installation-lane).

[repository-credentials-k3d-real.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/repository-credentials-k3d-real.test.mjs)
belongs to the explicitly selected `repository-credentials-installed` CLI lane,
excluded from both workflow groups and Full Integration dispatch. The lane is
temporarily refused until its remote cleanup is safe; see
[qualify an installed Agent against GitHub](repository-credentials-platform.md#qualify-an-installed-agent-against-github).

[repository-credentials-live.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/repository-credentials-live.test.mjs)
belongs to the `repository-credentials-live` lane, excluded from both workflow
groups and Full Integration dispatch. Follow the
[repository credential qualification guide](repository-credentials.md) for the
authorized disposable repository, protected service setup, and cleanup. The
automatic container lane exercises controlled provider behavior and separate
container credential isolation. A passing run establishes only selected checks
at its recorded source and images, not installed platform or live-provider qualification.

[postgres-azure-workload-identity.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/postgres-azure-workload-identity.test.mjs)
belongs to the `postgres-azure-workload-identity` lane, excluded from the `ci`
and `full` groups and Full Integration dispatch. Follow the
[Azure PostgreSQL test procedure](postgresql.md#azure-workload-identity-connections)
for private input setup and result handling. Ordinary constructor,
security-rejection, and password cases in
[postgres-connection-auth.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/postgres-connection-auth.test.mjs)
run in the mandatory `postgres-platform` lane.

[ssh-compute-real.test.mjs](../../tests/integration/ssh-compute-real.test.mjs) belongs
to the `ssh-host` lane, excluded from the `ci` and `full` groups and
Full Integration dispatch. No workflow provisions its disposable Linux/systemd
SSH host or invokes the lane. The readiness-only selector proves real-host
readiness, revision cutover, state isolation/persistence, and deletion without
a model call. The optional `OCC_TEST_SSH_MODEL=1` selector adds
[real provider execution and runtime credential proof](ssh.md#runtime-credential-model-proof).
Follow [SSH raw hosts](ssh.md#ssh-raw-hosts) for the disposable host, required
environment settings, and direct test command.

See [GitHub Actions testing](ci.md) for the automatic lanes and result accounting.
